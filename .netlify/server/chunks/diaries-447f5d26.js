    title: "7 Pro Tips on How to Make Your Breakin Sneakers Last Longer",
    html: `
    Hey whatsup everyone, Dyzee here, and today I want to share some gold knowledge which I have collected over the years when it comes to keeping your sneakers fresh and for as long as possible. Now it doesn't matter which particular brand or shoe you wear for Breakin, whatever is your preferred sneaker, these golden tips apply to all Breakin kicks! Before I begin, please allow me to give a bit of a back story.\r
\r
Growing up as a young Bboy, I was always searching for the best sneaker for my style. I went through almost every type of of sneaker until I settled upon the Puma Ligas and Adidas Sambas. However, these sneakers weren't so popular and were hard to find. So I eventually began trying to figure out ways to make them last longer, and later on, I began to figure out tricks to keep them looking clean as well. Some of my Breakin sneakers actually lasted over 10 years! Some of my Breakin sneakers I have until this very day.\r
\r
With the launch of my premium Pro Breakin sneakers under the Dyzee Threadz Sneaker company, I have become obsessed with designing and collecting sneakers made for Breakin. However, I wouldn't necessarily call myself a "sneaker head", because as a Bboy, what good is collecting sneakers that you can't or wouldn't dance in them? With that said, I have collected as much knowledge and developed methods for future Bboys and Bgirls to collect and preserve their collection to dance in. I call them "Sneaker Breakers".\r
\r
With that said, here are my biggest tips for keeping your Breakin sneakers FRESH.\r
<h3>#1 Buy multiple pairs of your favorite shoes to Break in</h3>\r
While this sounds like buying multiple pairs might be costly, it actually can save you money in the long run. Especially if you can buy your sneakers on discount or a two for one sale. Once you find your sneaker of choice, might as well buy a few pairs for different occasions, outfits and purposes. If you have only one pair of sneakers that you wear for all occasions, your sneaker will not last long and will be harder to keep fresh, which this is what it's all about, keeping your kicks looking fresh when you represent! Even if you only have two pairs, one is for keeping fresh and the other one is meant for "breaking" (pun intended)\r
<h3>#2 Don't wear your training kicks out on the street</h3>\r
<img class="diary-img" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1502" src=${two} alt="" width="300" height="200" />Breakin' already wears down your sneakers, but so does walking around all day and slowly scraping away your sole on the rough concrete. When your sneakers get dirty from the outdoors, you tend to not care as much about keeping them mint. Only wear your Breakin kicks for Training, showcases or special events. That way they will last so much longer and if you are like me who prefers to have bright outsoles, they will state white and bright for a long time, considering that dance studios are usually clean and most events are indoors.\r
<h3>#3 Designate your pair that is in the worst condition as your main trainers.</h3>\r
Eventually one of your sneakers will be in the worst condition compared to the others. Use your worst pair of sneakers when you know you are going to do heavy training, or working on moves that you know will scrape the floors. That way you can get the most mileage out of this sneaker, wearing it all the way down until you can no longer use it anymore. This will take the wear and tear off your other sneakers in your collection. Once your main trainer is completely done, the next sneaker in the worst condition will then take it's place. This takes me to the next tip...\r
<h3><img class="diary-img" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1501" src=${three} alt="" width="200" height="300" />#4 Have a pair specifically for out door dancing</h3>\r
Sometimes you have no choice but to Break out doors. I designate two pairs specifically for outdoor use. One pair I wear almost every day (Black 2Stepz), and even though I rarely ever dance in them, they already look in worst condition than all my other sneakers. However, if I did need to dance in them, I totally would! I also have a 2nd pair (White Elephantz) that I keep in relatively mint condition and I wear them outside when I want to look fresh, but know there is a chance that I might have to Break (ex: Going to a party). But all my other sneakers I never ever wear them anywhere but at training and if I was ever to go to an event, but only on the dancefloor!\r
<h3>#5 Buy a pair of baby wipes to quickly clean your sneakers after dancing</h3>\r
Whenever I come home, I use baby wipes to quickly wipe down all the white areas that have scuffs or dirt marks. When dirt settles into your sneaker, it becomes extremely hard to take them off. So while the scuff is still fresh and the dirt soft, clean them right away!\r
<h3>#6 Stuff your sneakers with tissue wrap or plastic in order to prolong the shape when your not using them.</h3>\r
Like pretty much all sneakers, the more you "Break them in", the more they conform to your feet and loose that brand new shape. You can preserve the shape by taking tissue paper or plastic and stuffing the toe part of the shoes. This is extremely help full when you put your sneakers into your back pack for training. This helps your sneakers retain the shape. When I get to training, I remove the tissue paper and stick them into my outdoor sneakers while practicing and when I'm done, I stuff them back into the shoe and adjust the shape before sticking them back in my backpack.\r
<h3>#7 Wash or replace your laces when they get dirty.</h3>\r
If you are like me and like to use bright color laces, nothing can make an old sneaker look brand new better than a fresh pair of bright laces. If you want to save on buying multiple pairs of fat laces, you can just take your laces off and wash them either by hand or in the machine.\r
<h3></h3>\r
<h3>BONUS TIP #8 Put your clean Breakin' Sneaker collection on display.</h3>\r
Now this bonus tip just helps you keep a collectors mindset and motivates you to keep your Breakin sneakers in as mint condition as possible. There is something about looking at your collection that makes you want to keep collecting and preserving them the best you can. Most people buy "black" because they know their sneakers will get dirty, but in this way, you can collect all types of colorways and never really worry about wrecking them when you dance once you truly learn the ways of the Sneaker Breakers.\r

<h3>On October 18th 2020, the "Showdown" between my business partner and student Harricane versus his biggest inspiration, my 7 Commandoz teammate Hongten just went down.</h3>\r
A lot of people have been talking about this all over the internet, giving their opinions about what went down, many people are asking me questions, so I wanted to make a vlog about this to Break Down my mixed emotions about the event.\r
\r
Firstly, I need to clarify my involvement with this event. I in no way, shape or form had anything to do with the actual organization and production of the event, other than the actual concept and format of the show down, and being the global social media coordinator. The entire event belonged to the Chiayi City Government, which is why you won't see any OUR City Bboys logos or Dream Runnerz logos on any of the "official" event artwork. The government hired Dream Runnerz as production staff to facilitate the event, and originally called the event "Capital of Street Dance" but later named the event Our City Bboys since the showdown concept was our idea.\r
\r
Where I come in, is that for the past 10 years since moving to Asia, I've dedicated my career to solving the problem why Bboys can't earn a proper living, so I created a business format to market "Showdowns" instead of "tournaments" to prove that regular people would want (and pay) to see a TRUE battle between two cities, and now between two Bboys (or Bgirls).\r
\r
About two years ago, I came to Taiwan to work with the top crew "Dream Runnerz" to turn their Bboy crew into a professional, city bboy team, with a business plan that is based off building a huge local fan base and leveraging their fans to sponsors and government support.\r
\r
So I really have to give it up to Dream Runnerz for they are the ones really putting in the legwork and executing the event, although at many times I feel that they could ask for my help and advice more.\r
\r
For the record, I think the event was a success, although production wise there are many things that I would have done differently. However it was a government event, therefore everything single thing needs to be approved.\r
\r
For example, one of the things I wanted to change was the word "call out", because although Harricane challenged Hongten, it was a call out to a "Showdown", not a cypher battle, and I think Bboys already have their own definition of what a "call out" is, so I would of made it a point to differentiate between a battle, a call out, and exhibition and a Showdown. Terminology matters and I want Bboys and Bgirls to understand that a Showdown is the best of both worlds, an official competition AND a real battle like in a cypher.\r
\r
I also think that a lot of more work could have been done for the build up to the main showdown as well as the stage and venue production, but perhaps that's just my high standards from working for R16 World Championships from 2011 to 2016.\r
\r
Nevertheless, this Showdown is another milestone for "The Plan" in the following ways.\r
\r
<strong>#1 We wanted to prove that a Showdown format can draw a huge local crowd and international attention</strong>\r
\r
The line for the event was crazy and the 1000 seater venue was packed to full capacity! Regular Bboy jams can barely get any general audience to come watch, which is fine because regular jams are more for the community to participate. But Showdowns are for the general audience and the fans, which is the lifeblood of any professional athlete/artist celebrity business.\r
\r
<strong>#2 Set a standard for Bboys getting paid well</strong>\r
\r
A lot of people are saying that Hongten didn't get anything out of this, but I wanted to assure everyone that Hongten wouldn't quarantine in Taiwan for 14 days, and another 14 days when returning to Korea for nothing. I told Harricane that if he wanted Hongten to battle him, he needed to offer him a deal that he couldn't refuse. Hongten agreed to a 5 figure deal. Yes, that is in USD, not taiwan dollars LOL.\r
\r
&nbsp;\r
<h4>Now what most people are wondering is, what did I think about the actual showdown itself.</h4>\r
Firstly, one of the things that I wanted to prove through this showdown format, is that in a real cypher battle, rounds tend to become shorter and straight to the point. That is why this this format is 3 minutes then a 90 second break to recharge. However, this back fired because of Hongten being absolutely inhuman.\r
\r
In the cypher, there is a strategy called "Nickle and Diming" which is where you throw short but sweet rounds to tire out your opponent but having your little moves add up overall. Majority of skilled Bboys, when faced with a short round, would throw a short round in return to save stamina. But Hongten did something incredible, he continued to throw FULL sets the entire time! 35 full throwdowns is an absolute anomaly, considering he had only 10 second quick breaks from Harricane's short runs. I can't think of a single person who can do what Hongten did that night, but if there is someone, I'd pay good money to watch them go at it with Hongten in the same format. I talked to Hongten and he told me he knew that Harricane would throw short rounds, so his strategy was to take his time and do full rounds no matter what in order to make Harricane's short rounds look ridiculous. This strategy completely blew my mind because when you think about it, if Hongten threw a short round, then he would of validated Harricane's short rounds. Crazy!\r
\r
One of the things that could have been presented better, is the OUR System that the showdown was being judged by. This version of the OUR System was judged battle by battle, so at the end of the 3 minute battle, the judges decide overall who won that category. However, despite me always saying that we need to use the OUR system icons, instead of the words Foundation, Originality, Dynamics, Execution and Cypher spelt in the Chinese language, I guess fair and transparent judging is always the last on priority list.\r
\r
Using the OUR System is extremely important for the general audience and fans, because they need to know who is winning or losing in real time, but more importantly they instantly need to know WHY. And even if they don't fully understand, they need to believe that the judging is fair and actually based on some type of standards, not just judges choosing whoever they "liked" better.If it was up to me, after every battle I would have announced each of the category winners ONE by ONE, in the same way we did at the R16 World Finals.\r
\r
With that being said, people watching the livestream who didn't know we are using the OUR system are probably wondering why and how there could have been any ties given, and how I personally could have voted for Harricane in the Battle Round number 2. To be clear, I was judging the "CYPHER / BATTLE" category which is probably the most misunderstood and forgotten perspective in Breakin today.\r
\r
The purpose of this category is preserve the original approach to battling in the cyphers, which was simply about humiliating your opponent with the intent to "bust egos", by cleverly responding to whatever the opponent does. Essentially, the cypher is about the conversation which many bboys and bgirls who grew up in the competition era, may have a difficult time understanding if they have never truly battled with beef in a cypher to the death.\r
\r
I've rewatched the 2nd battle and I still stand by my conviction that Harricane won the cypher perspective, but only for battle #2 in particular. Hongten won 4 battles and i believe I tied two. I made a quick video to explain what went on through my head for that particular battle.\r
\r
[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJx9n_JNLCg[/embedyt]\r
\r
&nbsp;\r
<h3>What Hongten was saying after Round #6</h3>\r
Now a lot of people have been asking me what Hongten said to the judges after Battle Round #6. After getting the okay from Hongten to publicly repeat what he said, I'll try to explain what he said and why, the best way I can.\r
\r
As many people probably figured out, at first Harricane was doing quick response rounds in order to weaken or gas out Hongten. But after a while, he soon realized that Hongten wasn't getting tired so he tried to do long last throwdown rounds in order to compensate but instead started gassing out himself. Even though he trained for 12 battles, nobody could have been ready for what Hongten pulled off that night. So eventually Harricane began doing short rounds out of necessity, while Hongten continued to do full throwdowns each and every time.\r
\r
As long as I've known the humble monster Hongten, there's only one thing an opponent should avoid at all time, and that is making Hongten angry.\r
\r
As I stated above, Hongten told me his strategy was to do long sets even though he knew Harricane would do short sets. He figured that doing long sets would force Harricane to do longer rounds instead of Hongten being drawn into doing short short rounds. So being frustrated by Harricane not doing longer rounds, he came over to me after round 6 and said something like\r
<blockquote>It's fine if Harricane wants to do my moves but what the &amp;%#*! This isn't BREAK the game! He should be doing his own move too.</blockquote>\r
Later on, Hongten apologized to me to explain he was just frustrated, and I told him I totally understand. Actually I feel partially to blame because short quick cypher rounds is a strategy that Harricane picked up from me by watching all my last battles where I got called out. For the past year, Harricane has been rampaging through Taiwan destroying all his haters in the cyphers. This probably gave him a sense of confidence when going up against his hero Hongten. But in hindsight, perhaps I should have explained to him that my short response rounds comes as defense where my main argument when battling in a cypher is... "Atleast I have my own style and you are doing all my moves!" Thus this particular strategy couldn't work for him against his hero and main inspiration, Hongten.\r
\r
Overall, Harricane knew that he was going to lose, but I don't think anyone knew that it would of been this bad. A straight 7-0 for Hongten, many Bboys are already talking about there should be Knock-Out rule, where if someone gets beat 5 categories straight, or atleast two battles in a row, the showdown should end.\r
\r
In many ways, I feel for Harricane, as a loss like that will either make you better or end your career. Many Bboys in my 90's generation I've seen quit after getting roasted. The ones who remained only got stronger. But I wanted to take a moment to present a totally different perspective.\r
\r
Harricane knew he was going to lose, but like me, he sacrificed his career, for the betterment of the global Bboy culture.\r
\r
What I mean by sacrificed his career, is that Harricane and the Dream Runnerz built an amazing Bboy battle business based on his massive local fan base which we built over the past 3 years of working on "The Plan". Being the leader of his crew, he already has sacrificed so much of his time and energy in becoming a real Bboy entrepreneur. If you want to be the best of the best, you need to give everything to your Breakin, and it's the reason why I sacrificed my competitive career in order to solve the economic problems which have plagued our community.\r
\r
Me, Harricane and many others have been talking about how much Bboyin seems like it is dying, and everyone is putting their hopes into the Olympics. However, without a new vision for the culture, our fate may end up like the 80's and mid 2000's in Korea when the 3rd mainstream wave (and death) comes... and goes. Harricane had a choice, battle someone more on his level, beat them and please his fan base who ultimately pay his bills, OR battle his hero Hongten, possibly risk losing his local fanbase and sponsor support, but inspire the international Bboy community by allowing everyone to witness this 1 vs 1 showdown format.\r
\r
Harricane knew that in order to make this showdown not only happen and sell out the tickets in a matter of a few hours, but to get nearly the entire global Bboy community invested to watch this, he would need to call out Hongten with the utmost confidence and create the type of buzz that is needed.\r
\r
Harricane leveraged his massive following, Dream Runnerz resources and ultimately utilized his sponsors and connections to offer Hongten a 5 figure deal he couldn't refuse, and very much deserves. How many other Bboys would be able to pull off something like this? While I have been working with him and guiding him, he was the one to do this and make it happen, risking everything for what?\r
\r
ANSWER: It's to chase the dream that Bboyin will one day, be as big as skateboarding or MMA.\r
\r
let me end with this... If Pro-bboys were ever going to get paid in the same level as pro-skaters, MMA fighters or Boxers, this would require a format that could conclusively prove who is truly the king of kings... and at this moment, it's HONGTEN\r
\r
&nbsp;\r
\r
<em>edit: One more positive outcome of this Showdown despite the mismatch, is that nobody can claim that it's just a show and that the results aren't real. Dream Runnerz as a team has been undefeated in the Show Down team vs team format and a few Bboys were claiming that the results are already determined. Despite there being a huge show element to this, the actual battles itself and the results are REAL!</em>

    title: "The 2 Step'z 2nd Prototype Breakin Sneaker is here!",
    html: `<h3>Ladies and Gentlemen, Bboy's and Bgirl's, after 3 months of non-stop work to prepare the 2nd prototype sneaker made specifically for world class Breakin, I'm pleased to announce that presale release of "THE 2STEPZ".</h3>\r
We decided to name this sneaker after the two step because:\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>The two step is most essential step needed for dance</li>\r
 	<li>The 2 Step is the most dynamic footwork pattern in Breakin (which leads to power)</li>\r
 	<li>this 2nd prototype Breakin sneaker is our 2nd step in our journey</li>\r
</ol>\r
While the Numbawonz were created for Olympic Level Breakin, the 2Stepz are made with a fashion state of mind, creating an all-suede perfect blend of street and sporty, designed for world class Breakin.\r
\r
Using the feedback we received from the Numbawonz, we added a longer tongue to better show the Dyzee Threadz signature freeze logo, as well as a tongue loop to hold the tongue in place.\r
\r
The 2 Stepz continues to maintain the qualities and benefits of the Numbawonz such as:\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>Lightweight &gt; Footwork and power is easier and faster without ankleweights...</li>\r
 	<li>Double Stitched &gt; Sneaker wear and tear is part of the Breaklife...</li>\r
 	<li>Soft Outsoles &gt; For all those hand and arm stepping styles...</li>\r
 	<li>Thin soles &gt; Try doing foot Threads with platform shoes...</li>\r
 	<li>Soft insoles &gt; For flips and high impact movement...</li>\r
 	<li>Flexy soles &gt; For crouching footwork...</li>\r
 	<li>Comfort-ability &gt; using cushioning around the ankles...</li>\r
 	<li>Consistent Grip &gt; anti-stick &amp; anti-slip out-sole material...</li>\r
 	<li>Eye Catching &gt; because Bboys and Bgirls want to raw attention to the feet</li>\r
 	<li>Hip Hop &gt; represented by the graffiti style arrows</li>\r
</ol>\r
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1422" src=${eight} alt="" width="300" height="300" />The 2Stepz presale begins on July 4th 12am Taiwan time until July 18th ends in Taiwan. The purpose of the presale is to not only give our greatest supporters and backers the ability to receive them first with a discount, but ALSO, we want to test which 3 or 4 colorways will be available for sale during our full company launch in Fall.\r
\r
This means that depending on which model and colorway a customer chooses, they may be one of the few to have that particular colorway... ever.\r
\r
With that said, there are four types of 2Stepz, each different in materials or purpose.\r
<h3></h3>\r
<h3></h3>\r
<h3></h3>\r
<h3>#1 The 2Stepz</h3>\r
The standard 2Stepz are the regular 1 solid color version of the 2Stepz, and is available for the Presale in four colors. Black, Red, Burgandy and Blue.\r
\r
[gallery columns="7" size="medium" ids="1431,1429,1428,1427,1426,1425,1424"]\r
<h3>#2 The 2Step FC'z</h3>\r
The 2Step Flag Color'z is an idea to create sneaker variations and colorways based on national flag colorways. With many countries using the color combination of red, white and blue, we figured this would be the first colorway to start off.\r
\r
[gallery columns="4" size="medium" ids="1436,1437,1438,1439" orderby="rand"]\r
<h3>#3 The 2Step DL'z</h3>\r
The 2Step Dead Leg'z are named after one of the most famous leg work moves, made famous by Dyzee and the Supernaturalz. Many moves, particularly in legwork, require the ability to slide on the sides of the shoes. This sneaker features special black felt materials used for the arrows. Colors available in Red/Black and Yellow/Black.\r
\r
[gallery columns="5" size="medium" ids="1440,1441,1442,1443,1444,1445,1446,1447,1448"]\r
<h3>#4 The 2Step WE'z</h3>\r
The 2Step White Elephantz are named after the spotless untouched subway cars, coveted by graffiti artists. A White Elephant is also term that refers to extravagant gifts that are pretty much unusable. The 2Step White Elephantz made of all Nappa leather and come only in White. They are so fresh and beautiful, that despite being the perfect white sneaker to dance in, the question is if one would even consider dancing in them.\r
\r

    title: "Breakin' (aka Break Dancing) is LUCRATIVE\u2026 but not for the Breakers",
    html: `
		Today I listened to an interesting podcast by AER entitled \u201CIs Breakin Lucrative?\u201D I was excited to see this topic come up because I have been speaking about this for the past 5 years and it was instrumental for me developing \u201CThe Plan\u201D, which is to teach Bboy crews how to create a \u201CBreakin Battle Business\u201D and create a self sustaining industry.\r
\r
<iframe src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/721893349&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true" width="100%" height="300" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe>\r
Listening to the podcast early in the morning while in bed next to my sleeping wife and 1 yr old daughter, I had to refrain myself from yelling at the pre-recorded podcast. While the host didn't say anything wrong, and each of the guests had legitimate opinions and questions expressed, I was hoping that someone would speak out and say \u201CYES BREAKIN IS LUCRATIVE!\u201D while also explaining why and how.\r
\r
Unfortunately there wasn't anyone who could go further into this lucrative industry perspective so this blog will be my attempt to shed light on the lucrativeness of Breakin from the perspective from an international Bboy who was behind the scenes, organizing one of the biggest global tournaments through the R16 World Championships, and witnessing millions of dollars moving in and out through the Breakin industry.\r
\r
[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De1A3DM_7GU[/embedyt]\r
\r
Firstly, let's define the word lucrative. The online dictionary definition of lucrative is \u201Cproducing a great deal of profit\u201D. While the amount in which constitutes a \u201Cgreat deal of profit\u201D is subjective, with a notion of the majority of Bboys being broke, let's set a low standard of a million dollars.\r
\r
Secondly, I need to clarify that I have yet to see an individual participant of the Bboy culture earn a million (off Breakin), but technically, an organization or company can earn a million dollars in profit and it doesn't have to be in one shot. It can be over a period of time, such as athletes signing million dollar contracts for a 3-5 year contract. A million dollars over 5 years is technically only 200 thousand a year, and those type of contracts may also include housing and other amenities worked into that budget. So one shouldn't let the phrase \u201Csigning a million dollar deal\u201D impress them too much.\r
\r
With that said, let me break down a few semi-hypothetical scenarios.\r
\r
Let's say there was large scale annual Breakin tournament that at the world finals on their best year sold 15,000 tickets for a median price of $50. On top of that, they sell out their merch, 1000 pieces of event shirts, hats, jackets at an average price of $20. They don't need to pay for their contestant's flight or travel tickets because they have 30+ qualifiers from all around the world who pays $1000 for licensing. Plus title sponsors who pays a total of $25,000 for gold and silver packages.\r
\r
<strong>To do a rough calculation:</strong>\r
<ul>\r
 	<li><strong>15000 tickets x $50 = $750,000</strong></li>\r
 	<li><strong>1000 merchandise sold x $20 = $20,000</strong></li>\r
 	<li><strong>30 qualifiers x $1000 = $30,000</strong></li>\r
 	<li><strong>Sponsors =$25,000</strong></li>\r
</ul>\r
<strong>Final revenue: $825,000</strong>\r
\r
Now as I said earlier, that wouldn't go to one person, but rather to the company. And of course, there are a lot of company and event expenses. Especially if you have 7 staff, each making 40k a year ($280,000). And of course, there are accommodations for all the guests, Hiring judges, DJ's, emcee', videographers, production costs, venue costs and prize money, when combined can be very costly. However smart businessmen will know how to lower or cut those costs in order to save on budget. Also, all the above revenue doesn't include government funding and support which is a whole different ballpark.\r
\r
Government funding is very strict on how the money is used and who is earning a profit. So many times a non-profit agency is formed in order to utilize the government funding to pay for the costs of events. For example, the government funding for R16 averaged about 1 million dollars per year throughout the 10 years of R16. The budget came from Korea's Ministry of Culture Sport and Tourism (MCST), and went to the Korea Tourism Organization (KTO) who then hired the Bboy agency (Cartel Creative) to organize R16 World Championships. The way that usually works is that the agency gets to retain a percentage of the budget. In the case of R16, my former company retained 20% of the million-dollar budget ($200,000) on top of all the other revenue streams as painted in the first example.\r
\r
Not all Government Funded events work like that. Let me give another semi-hypothetical scenario.\r
\r
Let's say there is Breakin Festival held in a city that funds around $220,000. The government may also have access to government owned venues and can give away free permits to use government properties. The rest of the budget would be used for accommodations, flights, sound systems, judges, prize money, etc. All that money would have to be spent, except for the normal agency fee of usually 20% ($22,000). But if they had 2000 participants who pay $65 for all access tickets ($130,000), as well as 30 vendors pay $500 ($15,000), and 20+ qualifiers who pay $1000 license fees ($20,000), plus 500 pieces event merchandise sold out at an average price of $20 ($10,000), and a small title sponsor who pays $10,000 cash, let's do a rough calculation:\r
<ul>\r
 	<li><strong>20% Agency fee = $22,000</strong></li>\r
 	<li><strong>2000 tickets x $65 = $130,000</strong></li>\r
 	<li><strong>30 vendors x $500 = $15,000</strong></li>\r
 	<li><strong>20 Qualifiers x $1000 = $20,000</strong></li>\r
 	<li><strong>500 merchandise x $20 = $10,000</strong></li>\r
 	<li><strong>1 Title Sponsor = $10,000</strong></li>\r
</ul>\r
<strong>Final revenue: $207,000</strong>\r
\r
With that said, after living in Korea and seeing and learning for myself how large scale events actually work, I realized that there IS money in Breakin\u2026 just not for the Bboys and Bgirls. Plus, only the good organizers have the potential to earn (or lose) real money. There is nothing wrong whatsoever with making big money from organizing events, because the promoters assume all the financial risk. But as long as you have a big event that can sell out 1500 to 2000 tickets, and have government support, you can earn enough money to do an annual event as a full-time job!\r
<blockquote>learning for myself how large scale events actually work, I realized that there IS money in Breakin\u2026 just not for the Bboys and Bgirls.</blockquote>\r
For example, there are countless big events in France that are marketed for their local city's general population. The average International Breakin event supported by the government sells about 1500 to 2000 tickets, each ticket averaging about 20 euros each, earning about 35,000 to 40,000 euros on Ticket sales alone. That with the other event revenue streams is enough for a single event promoter to organize their annual event full time. Of course, majority of Bboys are more community organizers rather than event promoters and usually lose money on events. However, good event promoters can read the numbers and turn a profit.\r
\r
This is the reason why I created \u201CThe Plan\u201D and the Breakin Battle Business, because I realized that if all one needs is to sell tickets to their local general audience and get government support, then technically, a crew can run their own local city event that is geared towards the general audience and in a way that can gain local government support. But the problem is that most crew annual events (anniversaries) are competition tournaments which the celebrating crew couldn't and shouldn't enter. As a matter of fact, the tournament (bracket style elimination) is a system that in some ways, exploits the participants.\r
\r
[gallery columns="4" ids="1407,1408,1409,1410" orderby="rand"]\r
\r
Tournament Bracket styles are only used for \u201Camateur\u201Dsports, while professional sports focuses on the BEST OF THE BEST, and pays them to perform and represent a specific city, country or brand. Can one imagine if the NBA or NFL, abandoned it's city franchise and play off format for one off tournament structure events like in Breakin? Focusing on the best of the best talent while building their local city following and selling millions of tickets while having the backing of the city government is the reason why professional sports can afford to pay their athlete's millions of dollars.\r
<blockquote>the tournament (bracket style elimination) is a system that in some ways, exploits the participants.</blockquote>\r
So with that said, for every athlete or artist that gets paid a million, there is a company that has earned double, triple or 10x more in order to pay the artist a million. We as a culture need to start marketing our local hometown heroes to their cities and build them a huge local fan base, rather than marketing annual events and dangling cash prizes like carrots to see which hungry Bboys will take the bait.\r
\r
For our culture to reach its full potential, we need to grow past the \u201Cone off\u201D annual event structure where only a select few good promoters can earn a decent living. If everyone of these good promoters, focused their attention on creating an official city team and set up huge rival city showdowns against other cities, not only could it earn as much revenue as an annual event, but like sports, can be organized more frequently, brining in an even greater profit AND, paying the Bboys and Bgirls what they truly deserve\u2026 and for Battling!\r
\r
I have already proven this business model in the small city of Chiayi where the Dream Runnerz has not only their own official Bboy clubhouse, but also the support of their local city government and has earned well from their rival city showdowns. For example, their battle last year against the New York City Hitsquad was supported by the government. There were 3500 tickets sold at an average price of $20usd, and nearly 1000 pieces of Dream Runnerz merchandise sold. Feel free to do the math.\r
\r
This is the Breakin Battle Business that is my lifes dream to teach to the true Bboy crews out there. It's something that I wish I had known before, so that my crew Supernaturalz could have kept going strong.\r
\r
With Breakin going to the 2024 Paris Olympics, there will be more government support opportunities, investors and interest in Breakin, but without a solid business infrastructure and model, the only ones who will be making real money are the promoters.\r
\r

\r
Once again, the value of Breakin is greatly undervalued. Breakin has millions and millions of views. This is the reason why Redbull is willing to spend 1.5 million euro for the BC One World Finals! Millions and millions of views = millions of advertising revenue worth.\r
\r
So, the answer is yes, Breakin is lucrative! But just not for the Bboys\u2026 yet!

    title: "Should we change the \u201CBboy\u201D terminology to be more inclusive to Bgirls?",
    html: `
		Recently I re-uploaded a video from a beginner intro series for easybreakdance.com called "Introduction to the Bboy Culture" which began receiving a lot of attention. Two of the closest Bgirls I know reached out to me to voice their feelings of exclusion by me using the term "Bboy culture". Right away I apologized as I fully understand that nobody likes feeling excluded. I realize that this is a very important topic and discussion that has not yet been fully discussed and debated in our global community. So I organized a livestream discussion with B-Girl Jilou. We agreed to make it more of a discussion rather than a debate because it's not about winning our points, but rather hearing all sides so that the culture can move forward together. The livestream discussion was on my @dyzeediaries Instagram account for approximately 1hr.\r
\r
[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFWNQlkhavo[/embedyt]\r
\r
Afterward the livestream, I sincerely felt that it was overall a great discussion. My take away is that when we promote to a general public, we need to come off as an all inclusive community, however, not losing our terms Bboy and Bboying since the overall goal is to transform Breakers into Bboys and Bgirls. With Breakin going into the Olympics and more and more people getting into the dance, there will need to be a thicker line drawn what differentiates a Breaker from a Bboy or Bgirl as they are not one in the same thing.\r
\r
With that said, the points I discussed I wanted to reiterate here in this blog as I feel I wasn't able to thoroughly express my ideas so I am writing this blog in attempt to further breakdown this complex issue.\r
\r
Firstly, I have to ask the questions, has there ever been any cases of Bgirls (or older age men) who have been denied participation to a "Bboy" competition? Or worst, has any Bboys ever excluded from their group or scene an amazing Bgirl, just because she is a girl, on the basis that it's for Bboys only?\r
\r
It's possible that there may have been cases of this, but never in my life have I ever heard of such a thing happening, therefore this brings me to my first point:\r
<blockquote>#1 The term "Bboyin" is actually age and gender neutral</blockquote>\r
As far as I have learned, seen and experienced in the past 25 years, the culture has never excluded against older men or girls from entering, competing or partaking in the culture what so ever (except for Iran where there is a strict muslim law where girls and guys cannot dance together in the same room).\r
\r
If there has been any cases of this, then I condemn it as it is absolutely wrong and against our culture's values and the perpetrators should be smoked, served and burned.\r
\r
Interestingly, Bgirl Battles are exclusive only to Bgirls. Bboys can't enter Bgirl Battles, but everyone and anyone can enter Bboy battles, including men of all ages, even bordeline gymnysts, trickers and circus performers!\r
\r
I've never heard a Bboy complain that we don't have our own exclusive categories. Basically, the Bboy culture is inclusive to anyone who isn't afraid to step into the cypher and get their feelings hurt and ego busted. Personally, from my experience, having had Bgirls in my crew and have dated one in the past, in general, Bboys and Bgirls approach "the culture"differently. As a matter of fact, I've always thought the way Bgirls approach the culture seems like they are having more fun, despite the obvious difficulties dealing with bad Bboy personalities. When you think about it, Bboyin in its very nature, is an extreme testosterone filled, chest puffing egotistical manifestation represented and channeled through a dance, art and culture, which brings me to my 2nd point that\r
<blockquote>#2 Bboyin was created for juvenile boys to deal with our toxic masculinity</blockquote>\r
Everyone knows that "Bboyin" was created in the streets, and by vile gang members as a result from the combination of a gang truce, the music, and the inherent nature to do what bad boys do. We are here to catch wreck(cognition), hurt feelings, but egoes and earn our proper respects. Now i'm not saying that all boys are like this, or that there aren't girls who think like this, but I'm making the claim that this way of behaviour and thinking is a part of our male DNA and I thank God that we have this culture for us to release that kind of energy in a positive and non life threatining kind of way.\r
\r
And that is the reason why it really matters to preserve the terms "Bboy and Bboyin" because of what they actually mean. While Breakin is a dance, and a breaker is someone who breaks, but a Bboy is someone who carries the spirit of the hip hop warrior and has an understanding of the cultures codes and values. This leads me to my 3rd point\r
<blockquote>#3 The term "Bboyin" has a very important cultural and historical meaning and tradition</blockquote>\r
It was not too long ago when our global community called ourselves Breakers. Very few people knew the difference between a Breaker and a Bboy. Many of the Breakers did not respect the OG's with countless beefs, online trash talking, and battles that ended up in fights and rumbles.\r
\r
In the early 2000's, Mex One (RIP) was one of the first to really push the idea and concept, that we are part of an actual culture... and not just a bunch of punks who break. Thus evolved a distinction between Breakin and Bboyin. Breakin is the dance we do, and Bboyin is the culture we live... similar to sword fighting and being a samurai, the difference is one lives by a code. Since those days, the term Bboy and Bboyin stuck, and many new young practitioners were hungry to learn what the difference is between Breakers, Breakdancers and Bboys.\r
\r
With that said, it's really hard for many of us Bboys to just let go of the terminology Bboy &amp; Bboyin, because of the history and meaning behind the name. That would be like asking witches to stop using the word witches and witchcraft so they can be more inclusive to warlocks. The same way that I'm sure that witches won't want to lose their name and the history and tradition behind it with no offense to warlocks, is the same way that Bboys feel about our terminology.\r
\r
Once again, it's about preserving the "meaning" of the word "Bboy" and in remembrance of what our community and elders went through in order for us to know the difference between a Bboy, a Breaker and a Breakdancer. Allow me to provide some reasoning why it's important to me particularly\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>Preserving the word Bboy, means preserving the meaning.</li>\r
 	<li>Preserving the meaning is preserving the traditions.</li>\r
 	<li>Preserving the traditions is preserving the true culture.</li>\r
</ol>\r
And lastly, preserving the true culture, is preserving lives from the streets... mine included. To put it simply...\r
<blockquote>#4 Meanings &amp; Traditions preserves the culture &amp; the culture saves lives</blockquote>\r
As dramatic as that sounds, it's true. Bboyin is a sub-culture of the Hip Hop culture, and the rules are governed by codes and rules from the street. While it's true that "Breakin" and the scene is constantly evolving and changing, we still want to have it's roots anchored in where it came from. The streets always need a place where "Boys can be Boys", and what better place for young disenfranchised and often fatherless youth to learn great values like, Skill, Rep, Props and leaving a Legacy among other countless values. Just like how boys fantasize about being that headhunting warrior, crusading knight or wandering samurai, the codes and spirit of the Bboy lifestyle can be enticing for the young men who need it the most.\r
\r
With that said, I would be down to completely change the name from Bboyin back to Breakin, if there was a way to transfer all that history, knowledge and meaning to the words Breakin and Breakers. However my reluctance to do so is from the fear that by doing so, we lose wealth of knowledge to know the difference when sayin, "I'm Bboyin" as opposed to, "I'm Breakin".\r
\r
For many of the true Bboy's who live by the code and witnessed the dance's transformation into a community and culture, they would be hesitant to give up the Bboy title. However, for Bboys who started Breakin in the last decade or so, especially with the growing amount of educated Bboys, they may be more open for making the change. For me, as reluctant as I am, I'd be down if our culture and community really sat down, thought about it and together decided we would change the terminology. However, knowing how Bboys think, there chance of that happening is very slim.\r
\r
With that said, there is one way that a Bgirl (or Bboy) can change the terminology, and that is to do it through the ways of the Bboy. If a Bgirl rose up who was so nasty with the skills, earned an international rep, has earned the highest level of props and thus changed the game where Bgirls begin taking over on the dance floor, only then will there be a shift and change which brings me to the last point\r
<blockquote>#5 Only legends change traditions</blockquote>\r
While I've heard some people call it celebrity worship, I believe that intangible props (proper respects) is a universal value and code of the culture. In the streets a name and rep carries more weight than a college education and one must prove him or herself first with their skills before they can speak on behalf of the culture. Fortunately, there have been more amazing Bgirls on the rise who have the skills and are earning a global rep. But who will be the first Bgirl to win a world title, though competing and defeating against the best Bboys, thus proving and earning what every Bboy and Bgirl truly wants... equality\r
\r

    title: "Why Tie Breaker Rounds are Important for the Bboy Culture",
    html: `Today I saw a shared video on my social media news feed called "Ties are bad decisions" by a Bboy named Razzy from Filthy Feet of Vancouver Canada. The video goes on to make some really good points why voting a TIE can be annoying to competitors, while at the same time acknowledging that ties are good for spectators. Some of Razzy's major points were:\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>Judges are being Lazy, they couldn't make a decision so they vote a tie</li>\r
 	<li>Two rounds can't be exactly the same</li>\r
 	<li>Abundance of criteria that Not making a decision shows lack of depth</li>\r
 	<li>It's the judges JOB to make a decision</li>\r
 	<li>It makes jams go on longer</li>\r
 	<li>It gives an unfair advantage to participants</li>\r
 	<li>It complicates things such as, who should vote the tiebreaker?</li>\r
</ol>\r
[embedyt] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiTGR64ykpE[/embedyt]\r
\r
While I do agree with these points on some level, something inside me disagrees from a perspective that comes from BEFORE Bboy competitions became the standard and the few that were around were meant to encapsulate the essence of the raw cypher battles which was the standard.\r
\r
The point of this blog isn't to debunk Razzy, but to provide a bigger perspective.\r
\r
<strong>#1 In some judges expert opinion, it SHOULD be another round.</strong>\r
\r
While there definitely are judges who hide their bias and the fact they aren't paying attention behind ties, on the other hand, there are judges who are judging on the traditional raw cypher standard of, it's not over until one of them knows they lost. A raw battle can go on and on until one of them is satisfied that they proven their point. An legendary battle goes on and on where both Bboys mutually give each other props, thus leaving it up to the crowd to rhetorically decide who inspired them more.\r
\r
So in a limited rounds competition, sometimes both sides have equally made their points in totally different approaches and none has either clearly "served" or "burned" the other. From a real Bboy perspective, both Bboys SHOULD want to go again until they have satisfactorily made their point. Making a decision when it's too close is not only robbing the Bboys of their chance to get in one last word, but it's also robbing the culture the chance to show how true battles "should" be approached... which is to always be ready to throw one more to get your final point in.\r
<blockquote>SIMPLE SOLUTION: Let all Bboys know that there is a chance to go one more round. Allow the judges to choose a tie if needed, but let the tiebreaker be the decision maker with no more ties, and let only the judge who tied, make his decision!</blockquote>\r
<strong>#2 Battles are supposed to be like an argument... not a competitive art contest</strong>\r
\r
While it's true that no two rounds are exactly the same, but if they were, it would be a lot easier to judge. What i mean is, if the first person did a specific style and finished with a specific move, and the other person did the exact same set, that would mean that the 2nd person won because he basically said, "Your stuff is so easy I can do the entire thing, watch!"\r
\r
Round for Round judging has really changed the way Bboys are Breakin these days and in someways, completely destroyed the rawness and true essence of a battle. In a true cypher battle, people rarely go round for round, it's usually an "overall feeling" like a conversation or debate. Therefore, this new approach of "im just performing my round, my opponent performs their round, and the judge decides who wins the round" is not only different from the original approach to battling, but it's also a step in the wrong direction for the culture.\r
\r
This approach to battling is from "Freestyle or Allstyles" competitions. Real Bboy battles (in the circles) are totally different. Bboy battles are a physical &amp; mental warfare where on uses his skills to humiliate and bust the ego of the opponent and crush their spirit, similar to how true rap battles are meant to be. Todays Bboy competitions are more like "spoken word contests" rather than "rap battles".\r
\r
My point is that a 1 round battle isn't really an argument since the first Bboy or Bgirl is only asking a question and doesn't get a chance to reply so the two rounds are completely different argument is irrelevant in a true Bboy battle context. But then again, due to time restraints, 1 round battles are necessary to save on time.\r
\r
SIMPLE SOLUTION: Continue with 1 round battles with a chance for a tie breaker.\r
\r
<strong>#3 It's the abundance of criteria that constitutes a tie decision to be made</strong>\r
\r
While Razzy made a god point that a tie can show lack of depth in a judge, I also believe that a judge who...\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>A) actually looks at everything and doesn't want to use his own personal bias to by putting more weight to his preferences...</li>\r
 	<li>B) Is hired for his specific opinion and preference and hasn't seen enough to make his decision...</li>\r
</ol>\r
is what could constitute the judge to objectively call a tie.\r
\r
For example, let's say I personally prefer originality, but one side was more original and overall better execution, but the other one was really dynamic with his style and actually responding, I might want to see one more round to see who is actually dancing more\r

    title: "Why the Success of the Bboy Sneaker Crowdfunder is a Game Changer",
    html: `On November 26, 2018 I publicly announced on my Instagram that I was planning to create the best sneaker for Breakin, asking people what were the top qualities and features that are important in a sneaker that is used for Breakin. I took the top 10 qualities, send a detailed document to a factory who spent a lot of time and money to create the 1st prototype sneaker designed specifically for Bboyin. But the looming question was, is the Bboy culture even ready for a Bboy sneaker? A lot of people brought up some very interesting points such as:\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>Majority of Bboys &amp; Bgirls are mindlessly loyal to big brands that don't care about Bboyin, but still would never switch because those brands already spent a lot of marketing money to be "ingrained" in the culture</li>\r
 	<li>Bboys don't support other Bboys until their gone. While someone might have a few fans who are willing to support, the vast majority would not only be against it, but would root for it to fail.</li>\r
 	<li>There simply isn't enough demand in the world for a Breakin sneaker</li>\r
 	<li>A durable good quality sneaker would make the product too expensive for the average Bboys because, majority of Bboys are broke</li>\r
</ol>\r
However, being a Bboy for a quarter of a century, I know how Bboys think. We are always looking for the perfect sneaker to Break in. While we like wearing nice brands, we usually don't match our shoes with our clothes, it's the other way around. We usually find the right shoes, then get clothes that match.\r
\r
While it's true that Bboys don't usually support other Bboys, but I do believe that we do support brands and entities that support us first, which is exactly what I want my brand to be all about, a sneaker company that's here to serve the community. Plus, when I'm gone or if something was ever to happen to me, the stocks of the company will definitely go up!\r
\r
So the last question I had to answer to my business and factory partners was, is there a global demand for quality Breakin sneakers and could I actually get the Bboys to support, despite the higher than normal price due to quality control?\r
\r
This is where I got the green light to not only prove my theories correct, but also use the fundraiser for the culture to purchase a significant stake in the start up company with myself as the first director, who will ensure that the culture's interest will always be put first.\r
\r
Now people who know me deeply, know that I'm not an "on the whim" type of guy. I have trouble making decisions and although I seem very positive on the outside, I am very skeptical and like to analyze things. On one side, I've been heavily invested in both time and finances in the Bboy Battle Business, I was wondering if I should even waste my time. However, I knew that this opportunity was too great, and plus, the business person I met was from my little church in Taiwan, I felt my heart telling me to trust in the one who's never let me down. It's funny because I have been lead me down paths that at the time, I thought was a failure but in hindsight, was a very significant lesson that i needed to learn in order to bring me to where I am today.\r
\r
So it's at these moments in my life that I take the time to meditate, pray and leave it up to the one who's brought me this far. It took me a while to begin setting up the official Indiegogo campaign but finally on August 21st, I finally launched the campaign which would end exactly 40 days later on September 30th, the day right after my 40th Birthday.Many people might not know the significance of the number 40, but it's a re-occurring number of days in the bible; 40 days and 40 nights. I took this as a sign... but could this really happen? $15000 USD was the minimum goal and it is quite a bit of money.\r
\r
In the first 2 days of the campaign, 30 percent of the goal was reached. I was utterly shocked how fast it was selling, but by the 3rd day, everything began slowing down. For the next 30 days I began putting out a series of promotional videos to keep the pre-sale in the minds of the community. Very slowly did the pre-orders come in, i began worrying that everyone who really wanted the sneaker already got it and there was nobody left.\r
\r
Approaching the halfway point in the campaign, there was 4 straight days without one single purchase. When we finally reached the halfway point on September 10th, we still didn't yet reach 50% of the funding. I began to worry, and began wondering if my haters were laughing at me. I actually heard from sources the types of things they were saying and consequently, I was wondering if I was intentionally being sabotaged.\r
\r
With all these negative thoughts going through my head, I realized that I just need to continue having faith, that if this is truly destined and God willing, then I couldn't do anything to stop it, even if I really tried. In the end, I don't have any control over anything. I only have control over my own actions and my own thoughts, and that I would continue to be professional and keep pushing till the very end. Five days later on September 15th, we finally hit 50% funding.', 'Why the success of the Bboy Sneaker crowdfunder was a game changer`

    title: "What I've learned from bringing OUR City Bboys to the Philippines",
    html: `As many people may have already seen or heard, we held the first Prototype SHOWDOWN in Manila between a crew that's been representing Bacolod city since 2000 called Critical Breakdown, versus a newly formed all-star squad from Metro Manila, under the name Manila Soul. The purpose of this blog is to explain the "business, strategies and behind the scene's" for this event.<br/><img class="wp-image-1243 size-medium" src=${b} alt="" width="300" height="200" /><br/> Scenes from the OUR CIty Bboys battle between Manila Soul (Manila) vs Critical Breakdown Crew (Bacolod) on March 17, 2019 in San Juan City. Mark Demayo, ABS-CBN News[/caption]\r
\r
Firstly, the main objective of this showdown, was to give the Philippines the chance to witness what an OUR City Bboys "Showdown" is all about. Majority of bboys in the world have a strange mindset when it comes to the Breakin scene. Many Bboys and Bgirls think that the "competition tournaments" are traditional battles, and that any deviation from them isn't keeping it real!\r
\r
However, anyone who was breakin before the competition era explosion will know that battles are NOT what they used to be and that a REAL battle is only between two teams. The first main objective of the Showdown, is to bring it back to what battles use to be all about, where both crews will burn through all their arsenal, stamina and egos, ultimately proving who is the better squad, while earning each other's respect and at the same time, giving both the crews and the audience, a battle that they will remember.\r
\r
Just like a drug dealer will give a way a "hit" to hook a "custy", my strategy here was to give the Philippines a dose of REAL BBOYIN &amp; HIP HOP to make the dancers, audience and potential sponsors, want more!\r
\r
This is the reason why this showdown was considered a real success, because everyone who went absolutely loved it, had the time of their lives, and can't wait to see their city battle again!\r

\r
With that said, although I had the idea of creating this Showdown since January, we really didn't start promoting it or working on the back end until 10 days prior to the event. I'm sure the Bboys were wondering why haven't we promoted it. Why haven't we started putting up posters all over the place and begun advertising it? Wouldn't that have made sense to do that months early so people can plan?\r
\r
Well, the truth is that I wanted to prove that this is a lot more different than the average type of Bboy event. These showdowns will not sell unless we get to the heart of why the showdown is important, which means, why the heck would anyone care to watch? People need an invested interest in order to want to go out of their way to see this battle, and that is what I did by just telling them what to do, which is, BE HIP HOP.<br/><img class="alignleft wp-image-1249" src=${d} alt="" width="436" height="241" /><br/>Back in my days in the 90's, before the internet, cell phones and Bboys competitions, the only place we could find other Bboys was through "the grapevine" which means, word of mouth. When we heard of another crew, we would go out of our way to find them by phone or pass on a message through mutual friends that we were coming to find them at the next party we knew they would be at and battle them. This word of mouth would spread like wild fire and because we agreed on a time and place, the party would be packed because everyone that heard about the beef and drama would come to see the showdown. These days, in the age of theinternet, with constant promotions and spam thrown in your face, people have become immune to the constant barrage of advertisements. <img class="wp-image-1250 alignright" src=${e} alt="" width="270" height="415" />People need <img class="alignleft wp-image-1252 size-medium" src=${f} alt="" width="281" height="300" />something more real and authentic. There's nothing better than a little old organic beef! All it took was for Critical Breakdown to officially call out Reflex from Manila on a facebook post and tag him which generated 73 shares. But it was the video reply from Reflex on his personal page which generated 87 comments, 182 shares and 8.5k views in just a few days.\r
\r
In addition, i quickly whipped up a small teaser which gained 4.6k views and we also were able to film a small press conference interview the day before which gathered 96 shares and 6.8k views on facebook.\r
\r
Now that might not sound like a lot in comparison to some viral online Bboy videos, but the target customers aren't global online views, but rather, the target audience is only people from MANILA. However, that won't be an easy feat for 2 reasons.\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>It's hard to get people to go out of their way to see something they have never seen or been to before</li>\r
 	<li>In the Philippines because of traffic, people are weary of heading out to places unless they plan in advance.</li>\r
</ol>\r
<img class="alignleft wp-image-1255" src=${g} alt="" width="226" height="256" />So our goal was to rent a limited capacity venue, and invite a hand full of potential sponsors, supporters and investors into the Manila Soul team, while proving not only that the Showdown is the dopest raw entertainment they have ever seen, but also that we know how to properly brand and market and build hype around the event. We needed to prove that we can make this work with a limited amount of time, resources and budget, which we did! Now imagine if we had the time and financial resources? That is the question which we ask our potential sponsors!\r
\r
Overall, what we are doing with OUR City Bboys, is helping the best bboys from every scene, become professional battlers by building a local fan base and business. The Philippines will be difficult because of the huge contrast in social classes. The poor are really poor, the middle class is poor, and the rich are super rich. There aren't too many in between. What i've learned from this trip is that we need to build and market this league in two directions.\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>Made for television: in order to keep it raw but maximize the number of viewers in the Philippines so that media and sponsors will want to be involved while keeping the street and gridiness aspect intact</li>\r
 	<li>Turning the raw bboys into professionals: Cleaning them up, teaching them how act and be around a higher social class, that way we can market these teams to a higher social class who has the money to pay to watch the best Bboy battles in their lives.</li>\r
</ol>\r
Perhaps this is the exact same way this needs to be done around the world, the same way that rappers and skaters have done it. Only time will tell, but we are on track.\r
\r
Will be back to the Philippines in November for the SEA GAMES, and I hope to set up the Manila Soul team against a Taiwan team! Perhaps the Dream Runnerz? If not Dream Runnerz, who?\r

    title: "NYC VS DRZ Twitch Livestream by Joey Kaotyk",
    html: `
		As many Bboys and Bgirls already know, the first "conclusive exhibition battle" went down in history in Chiayi city Taiwan on January 5th 2019 between the New York City Hitsquad VS the Chiayi Dream Runnerz.\r
\r
My plan was to prove that Bboys and Bgirls can organize their own home city exhibition battles, building die hard fans, while attracting sponsors, investors and government support. This event successfully proved that we can sell "a conclusive battle" to the general audience, selling the venue capacity tickets of 3500 people! This event not only brought in more general audience than majority of huge sponsored "free" events, but was able to provide enough value for an audience who would pay for tickets which relative to Taiwan's average income, is quite expensive!\r
\r
Unfortunately me and the Dream Runnerz were so busy with the event that we decided not to focus on a livestream, as our main audience and target market is primarily Chiayi city, although we do have some professionally captured footage which we have some plans for that.\r
\r
However, I'm happy to announce that a livestream was taken on my little homie Joey Kaotyk's twitch livestream. I watched the livestream starting at 6hr and 30 min mark and let me say, I really enjoyed his commentary more than I enjoyed any of the other livestream commentaries, mainly because his commentary was real and authentic, and he also was speaking directly to his followers who were watching. I also mentored Joey before and he translated a lot of my workshops so he was very familiar with the OUR system criteria which he was able to explain to his audience. I really loved that!\r
\r
I read all the chats and live comments as I continually want to know what my audiences are thinking. Everyone watching absolutely loved the battle and went through a full range of emotions. What i realized is that all the people watching automatically became fans of either Chiayi DreamRunnerz or NYC Hitsquad, and pretty much was with them until the end.\r
\r
Below is his livestream, but if you want to watch with the live comments you will need to go directly to his twitch page to see it. Otherwise you can watch here.\r

Please feel free to share and sign up for my email list to be updated on all my milestones!\r

    title: "Creating the first ever Sneakers made specifically for Bboyin!",
    html: `<img class="wp-image-1228 alignleft" src=${h} alt="" width="194" height="243" />Hello, it's 2019 a brand new year, and I have been busy with so much work according to "THE PLAN", but I have received an opportunity to create the first Bboyin Sneakers.\r
\r
Recently while here in Chiayi Taiwan, I was asked if I wanted to create a sneaker for the Bboy culture and future "sport" of it. Of course immediately I said yes, because I sincerely believe that Bboyin needs it. So right now, we are in the prototype phase. I'm actually so busy that it's hard to spend any time on this, but I believe that there needs to be a "Bboy Sneaker Company" which will design the best shoes possible for dancing.\r
\r
I'm pleased to announce that I have already made a prototype! I'll be releasing more information on it soon! The cost to start this shoe will be heavy but I believe that through God, anything is possible!\r

    html: `A few months ago, I was contacted through email about a blog article on "The Plan". Just like the topics of Bboyin, God and the Illuminati,(lol) anything about Bboyin as a business, I'm totally down to discuss and share my experiences, opinions and expertise. So we corresponded back and forth a few times and when the article finally came out, I was well pleased that there are people out there who can fully comprehend exactly what "The Plan" is all about.\r

<p id="a212" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Many aspiring b-boys and b-girls have dreamed of a scene like this. I can admit that I've fantasized about battling together with my crew, and making a living without having to rely on inconsistent winnings or side gigs. Unfortunately, only a handful of b-boys today are paid to train and battle full time. This doesn't indicate a shortage of talent, but rather, a lack of infrastructure and opportunities that often forces talented breakers to decide between financial stability and what might as well be a pipe dream.</p>\r
<p id="d022" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But there is hope one man is working to make a change. He is<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" data-href="/">Karl \u201CDyzee\u201D Alba</a>, a Filipino b-boy from Toronto's storied Supernaturalz crew, former  global tournament producer of the R16 international events, as well as creator of the criteria-based O.U.R. system for judging. Dyzee has made a name in virtually every category of breaking: inventing techniques, producing events, making videos, teaching, judging, and of course, winning plenty of competitions. If anyone has the knowledge and experience to fundamentally advance professional breaking, it's Dyzee.</p>\r
<p id="a3b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Within the last year or so, Dyzee has been developing \u201CThe Plan,\u201D which is essentially a business model for breaking battles as a sustainable industry.</strong>His<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hvJBmsOzFI&amp;list=PLDQs-s9xEiag5jEaQk2xXZr2G5aDaHVDv" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hvJBmsOzFI&amp;list=PLDQs-s9xEiag5jEaQk2xXZr2G5aDaHVDv">series of vlogs</a>shows clear progress in making this a reality. Recently, The Plan reached a major milestone: Dyzee successfully piloted his business model in Taiwan. Check out the video below, and then we'll summarize the key points of The Plan.</p>\r

<p id="ede1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Fans, money, merch seems perfect, doesn't it? But, as Dyzee mentions, it takes business and entrepreneurship skills to create lasting value from breaking events.<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Let's review the main points of this exhibition battle business model:</strong></p>\r
\r
<ul class="postList">\r
 	<li id="53cf" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Value proposition: Bringing the beauty of breaking to all audiences.</li>\r
 	<li id="47ca" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Primary goal: To generate and monetize fan bases for city crews. On a broader level, this results in a consumer base for breaking as a whole.</li>\r
 	<li id="b952" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Revenue streams: Includes ticket sales, merchandise, and sponsorship deals. Target consumers are from outside the existing breaking community. \u201CMake money for b-boys, not from b-boys.\u201D</li>\r
 	<li id="1b93" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Expenses: Venue rental, equipment, personnel, and talent (b-boys/b-girls), and marketing, to name a few.</li>\r
 	<li id="ddfc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Success factors: Events must be regular and connected, i.e. each battle leads to the next. Rivalry between city crews must be clear and enticing.</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p id="b569" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Though producing city vs. city exhibition battles already seems like a complete business, there's more to The Plan.</strong>Creating a dedicated fan base is just one out of three key components. Here are the remaining two:</p>\r
\r
<ul class="postList">\r
 	<li id="6e51" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Building</strong><a class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" href="/bboy-business/7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-href="/bboy-business/7/"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Blockhouses</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">in major cities/regions.</strong>Blockhouse refers to a \u201Cclubhouse/battle arena/ ultimate training spot.\u201D This facility would presumably include practice space, a social area, and a main performance space. Hopefully, Dyzee can surmount challenges like fundraising and finding the right business partners. If he does, the opening of the first Blockhouse will be a momentous occasion for The Plan.</li>\r

</div></figure>\r
<ul class="postList">\r
 	<li id="abbd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Establishing a \u201CB-boy social club\u201D in each Blockhouse.</strong>Rather than limiting usage to single crews, Blockhouse facilities and programs will be available to all who pay a membership fee. Opportunities to battle and make money will also be available to club members. Ideally, these incentives will encourage breakers in the same area to join the club and work together. 8\u201315 of the best breakers in the club will form the all-star team that represents a given city against other city crews.</li>\r
</ul>\r
<p id="9181" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Eventually we might see \u201Crival city/turf battle leagues,\u201D complete with scores, statistics, and standings that lead to championships. Of course, there are considerable obstacles to all parts of The Plan. Money is always short when it comes to the breaking community, rival crews may not want to work together, and business acumen is not the most common trait among breakers. Add in country-specific complications, and you have yourself a real challenge.</p>\r
<p id="a7ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">However, I remain confident in Dyzee and The Plan. The core business model is clear in how it generates value for breakers and other consumers.</strong>Secondary problems may hinder progress, but shouldn't indicate any issues with the core concept. Furthermore, Dyzee has already succeeded on a regional scale with one component of The Plan, and is currently working on the remaining parts, along with expanding to other countries.</p>\r

It's not just because the template has 9 sections\u200A\u2014\u200Athis level of consideration is necessary for any startup. Dyzee will likely revise and add to the Canvas with each periodic reassessment, incorporating new information as the project develops. For the rest of us, this one-pager is a valuable glimpse into one of the most promising ventures to emerge from the world of breaking.</p>\r
<p id="717a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The Plan is immensely important to the future of the breaking community. Regardless of how far this project goes, it will be a pioneering example of breaking's potential to become a sustainable industry.

    title: "Why Bboyin Was Better Back In the Day (repost)",
    html: `<strong>Just recently, someone contacted me, asking me if I had this old 2013 blog from on file since the R16 website has been down and this blog has now been erased. So i went through my old hard drive to see if I could find it and<em>viola!</em> So here I am reposting this blog since re-reading it and realizing that it still relevant today. So without further ado, here it is!</strong>\r

<h1><strong>Why B-Boying was better back in the days</strong></h1>\r
By Dyzee - Supernaturalz / R16 / O.U.R. B-Boys\r
\r
&nbsp;\r
\r
Now I know that the title of this blog may offend some people. Many times we hear of OG B-Boys ranting that \u201CBreakin\u201D was better back in the days. Now of course there are plenty of things that are better now than before, such as:\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>The ability to make money from Breakin through Judging and Workshops</li>\r
 	<li>Big events that unite Bboys from different places around the world</li>\r
 	<li>More events worldwide to compete at and provide competitive inspiration</li>\r
 	<li>More access to B-Boying through the internet which helps to grow the international community</li>\r
 	<li>A bigger fan based audience for B-Boying</li>\r
</ol>\r
Now just to make things clear, I am in no way saying that B-Boying should go backwards to the way it was back then. Large events and competitions are vital to the community's sustainability. What I, and many other older generation B-Boys are saying is\u2026 that there are many things from the past, which are missing from B-Boying today, and those very things are greatly missed by us, and may one day be regretfully lost, which will change the essence of B-Boying forever.\r
\r
Here is a general list of reasons why B-boying was better back then in the 90's and early 2000's.\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>There was less politics</li>\r
 	<li>There was more of a Freedom to Break the way you wanted to.</li>\r
 	<li>Real Cyphers existed</li>\r
 	<li>Competitions were a lot more like Cyphers</li>\r
 	<li>Battles were more like a raw street fight, less like an art show</li>\r
 	<li>There was more loyalty, friendships and relationships.</li>\r
 	<li>Being a Bad Boy was just simply more fun</li>\r
</ol>\r
<strong>#1 Less Politics:</strong>\r
\r
Back in those days, it was generally accepted that there's no money in Breakin. People did it just for the love. So the average career span of a B-Boy was about 2 years, basically until they went to college, found a girlfriend, a job, another hobby, or hit life responsibilities. It wasn't until the mid 2000's that more competitions began popping up all over the place, and through these competitions, there was a need for Judges. People soon realized that one could make money from being a judge. Finally there was a way for B-Boys to make money from Breakin\u2026 and thus began an era where all B-Boys began to fight and push their own perspectives as the correct way to Break, in order to secure work through Judging gigs. The politics and quest for power created all the divisions within the scene, and no longer were beefs being settled by the awesome tradition of battling, but were done by slander and sabotage. Today the politics in B-Boying has risen to whole new levels, but is now being done in secret. Unless you were Breakin back in those days before the politics, you wouldn't be able to understand how the politics of today, made breakin back in the day that much better. These politics greatly affected the outcome of the scene and the way people break, which brings us to the next point\u2026.\r
\r
<strong>#2 There was more of a freedom to Break the way you wanted to:</strong>\r
\r
Back in the days, there was no right or wrong way to break. You would know if your style is legit or not when you put it to the ultimate test\u2026 in the circle! There was nobody to tell you what to do, or how to express yourself. You would know if you are wack or legit after any battle in the circle. You felt it when you lost and knew if you won. Sometimes both sides thought they won, but the long grueling battle would create respect for one another. Nowadays, many B-Boys are looking to the judges for validation, instead of looking into their own hearts and being true to themselves. I can't really blame them, because for the past 6-7 years, there were no benefits for being different, especially in competitions.\r
\r
Back in those days, EVERYONE DID WHAT THEY WANTED TO, and at the same time, they were open to trying everything. If someone who did only power battled someone who did only footwork, they both would walk away confident in what they won in, and they knew what they needed to work on for the future. Nowadays, we have judges who are telling the new generation how to break, each of these judges saying different things, no wonder B-Boys are so confused how to break. The legends of the 90's, 80's and 70's never needed workshops; all they needed was the circle, because the circle was the ultimate teacher. No wonder there are so many B-Boys today who claim that cyphers are better. People today though get it twisted, they look at cyphers like it's a requirement for validation by the community, where it is actually supposed to be a validation tool for one's own personal use, which leads me to the next reason why B-Boying was better back then.\r
\r
<strong><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1192" src=${k} alt="" width="300" height="225" />#3 Real Cyphers Existed:</strong>\r
\r
Nowadays, many B-Boys are dancing in circles and cyphers as if they are in a competition being judged to see if they can be validated as a \u201Creal B-Boy\u201D. No longer are people vibing in the circle by sharing all types of ideas and concepts. Back in the days, a circle was like an intense conversation or debate, each person is sharing their approach, style and moves. When someone sees a similar approach, style or move, they add into the conversation with their upgraded versions. This exchange was continued until the circle has \u201Cdeciphered\u201D who is the \u201Cone\u201D. Now through these cyphers, everyone in the circle would begin to know exactly who is:\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>The best two in the circle</li>\r
 	<li>Which B-Boys should be paired up to battle against each other based on similar styles or moves</li>\r
 	<li>If people had beef</li>\r
</ol>\r
Naturally, the best two in the circle, and/or any specific or similar approaches or styles would end up battling, \u201Cnaturally\u201D and unforced.\r
\r
Today, B-Boys are just \u201Cdancing\u201D in the circles as if they are alone in a studio, or being judged on a showcase run. What's the point of dancing with other people if you're not \u201Ccommunicating\u201D? Now I'm not saying that real cyphers don't exist anymore what so ever, but it's a lot rarer these days. Even many so called \u201Ccypher B-Boys\u201D aren't really \u201Cde-cyphering\u201D anything in the circles. This is a lot different to how things were back in the days, when all B-Boys who cyphered, just naturally knew what to do. This brings me to the next topic\u2026\r
\r
<strong>#4 Competitions were a lot more like cyphers</strong>\r
\r
Back in the late 90's and early 2000's, competitions were a lot more like cypher battles. The B-Boys didn't care about judges, cash prizes, fame, politics or anything except\u2026 1-upping their opponents. Judges weren't there because of personal opinion or subjective tastes; they weren't there to be kings sitting on a chair, deciding the gladiator's fates. They were there to be honest and truthful servants to the competitors. After a battle, the B-Boys would be like, \u201CDayum we smoked them fools, right?!\u201D as they would look at the judges to agree. To plainly put it, the judges were there for the B-Boys, not the other way around.\r
\r
Today, judges are the kings of the competition. They decide the B-Boys fates. A B-Boy can technically do everything right and still lose, likewise a B-Boy can do everything wrong and still win. Judges base their decision based on politics and personal bias.\r
\r
Competitions are a lot different today in the sense how people battle. Back in the days, people battled like how they did in the cyphers, it was all about the conversation, how someone could 1-Up the opponent. This is where the term \u201Cgetting served\u201D came from. It meant, to do something that the other person can't comeback to. Since the unofficial implementation of the whole \u201CRound for Round\u201D judging, it completely changed the way the entire scene approaches battles. From being short, 1-upping straight to the point sets, to now, long ass rounds filled with generic fluff to \u201Ctry and win rounds\u201D, this brings me to the next point\u2026\r
\r
<strong><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1194" src=${l} alt="" width="300" height="225" />#5 Battles were more like raw street fights and less like an art show:</strong>\r
\r
Back in the days, the energy of the crowd was way better, not just because breakin was relatively fresh, but because they already knew how to properly approach and enjoy a battle. They approached it as one enjoys a boxing match or a street fight, not like a competitive art show. This is probably due to the way that the B-Boys \u201Cused to\u201D battle. Back in the days, if the other crew sent in a person who had dope toprocks, you would send in your member with the best toprocks. If the other crew sent in a person who did flares, you would send someone who does better flares. They would respond with someone who 1-ups it, and you would respond doing the same. The conversation and build-up of the battle would cause the energy of the crowd to explode.\r
\r
Nowadays, there practically is no more conversation in a competition. Round for Round judging killed the true essence of a battle. B-Boys in their very nature, adapted to this mentality of judging by no longer focusing on the opponent, but focusing on ticking boxes, trying to cover everything so that the judges can give them a \u201Cpoint\u201D for winning a \u201Cround\u201D. No wonder B-Boys don't want to go first in a battle anymore! Back in the days, B-Boys couldn't wait to get in there to \u201Cserve\u201D their enemies. But nowadays, if you want to win the competition, you need to follow the unwritten rules and adhere to the politics. No wonder B-Boys today are all making \u201Cassociations\u201D and \u201Cclubs\u201D based on politics and personal tastes instead of real homegrown crews, which brings me to my second last point\u2026\r

\r
<strong>#6 There was more loyalty, friendships and real relationships:</strong>\r
\r
Back in the days, you got down with a crew based on:\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>Your geographical location (where you \u2018re from)</li>\r
 	<li>Friendships outside of breakin</li>\r
 	<li>Your first crew of friends quit breakin so you joined a more serious crew.</li>\r
</ol>\r
Crews were created a lot more through actual friendships. Each crew had different minded people in the crew, usually from different backgrounds. The skill level in the crews often varied, some were a lot better or serious than the others. But in the end, it didn't matter; they all had each other's backs.\r
\r
&nbsp; 1st - 5th Generation[/caption]\r
\r
<span style="font-size: 16px;">Nowadays, B-Boys come together and make clubs or associations based on:</span>\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>Politics</li>\r
 	<li>Same political tastes or preferences (Foundation B-Boys, Originality B-Boys, Powermove B-Boys)</li>\r
 	<li>Money (winning battles, sponsors, etc)</li>\r
</ol>\r
Today, B-Boys approach being in a crew like Sports teams, people joining and leaving, coming and going like revolving doors in a cheap hotel. Back in the days, when you got down with a crew, it usually wasn't because of your skills, it's because you had the passion to break, you were cool, showed potential and your crew became your family. You never got kicked out of your crew, even if you were wack. This brotherhood and loyalty caused members to have this pride to back up their crew, or train to get better in order to represent the crew properly. These were the days, when there was true unity in Breakin. Crews consisted of all skill levels, and all styles, (Footworkers, Powermovers, Abstract style, Freezes\u2026. Even Poppers!) Everybody in the crew had a job or role. These relationships and mechanics of what it meant to be in a crew, and what was experienced together, leads me to my last and final point\u2026\r
\r
&nbsp;\r
\r
<strong>#7 Being a Bad Boy was simply more fun:</strong>\r
\r
I purposely wrote Bad Boy (\u201CBad\u201D was the original word that represented the letter \u201CB \u201C) because that was what we were, Bad Boys. What bad boys used to do, was cause trouble, hang out with the boys, go to parties, and sometimes get in brawls, rumbles and street fights. Even after getting beaten up, the boys stuck together and either won together or lost together. Either way, it was all for fun! This was the result of complete boredom and the lack of alternative things to do. Similarly, this is how the B-boys used to role, except rumbles, brawls and street fights were \u201Csometimes\u201D replaced with battles. Reputations were earned and legends were made, but the bonds and memories would last a lifetime.\r
\r
Nowadays, due to the list above of politics, lack of freedom, real cyphers and crew loyalty, B-Boying has become something a lot different than what it was before. Of course there are benefits in this generation such as the opportunity to making a living from B-Boying, huge competitions and the growth of B-Boying all over the world, it balances out the latter. However my point is that there is still something missing. I do not wish that B-Boying will go back to how it was, but I do wish that we can take what we had back then and incorporate it in the future.\r
\r
This is the reason why I've been painstakingly pushing so hard with the O.U.R. System, because I am trying to fix all the problems I listed above in this blog, such as politics, lack of freedom to dance how wants to, 1 upping each other in battles. I'm not trying to change B-Boying into something different, but ironically, I'm trying to get it back to the way it used to be, when it was better, like back in the days.\r
\r

    title: "5 things I learned about bringing \u201CTHE PLAN\u201D to the Philippines",
    html: `My wife and I just got back from the Philippines after a month long "babymoon" vacation, possibly one of the best trips I've ever had.\r
\r
As I've stated in my previous vlogs, the main purpose of this trip was to take a pre-parental last vacation with the wifey where she can just chill out, relax and "spa" out, which we did. We not only got massages 3 times a week, but we also got facials, manicures, pedicures and our hair done. The Philippines is a place where the the cost of services is very low due to the dollar to Philippine pesos ratio. With the minimum wage being roughly around $250 US dollars a month, what would cost a lot of money in other countries can go a long long way in the Philippines.\r
\r
Now my secondary goal was to keep writing in my upcoming book, the "Tao of the Bboy" which I have already gotten to chapter 10.\r
\r
However my third and final goal was to do some research in the Philippines to see if "The Plan" could actually work in the Philippines. I've been doing a lot of scene building work in the Philippines since I launched my Project P-Noise mission in 2010, by organizing the first series of international qualifiers while coaching and teaching throughout the nation. Now the Philippines has succeeded in making "noise", by developing their skills, earning a rep, getting their props and are on their way to leaving a legacy.\r
\r
Therefore, I was saddened to hear that the Philippine Bboy scene been slowly been dying. Although there are many young new faces and talent in the scene, a lot of the old crews and Bboys have quit or moved onto other things, primarily because they need to deal with the facts of life. This problem isn't unique to the Philippines, it's the same problem in almost every country in the world where a Bboy scene exists.When Bboys can't earn a living from dancing, they need to then focus on other outlets to survive. While privileged Bboys who grow up in 1st world countries can afford to Break as a hobby, the less fortunate Bboys will be forced to quit, doing what needs to be done to survive by any means necessary... or starve.\r
\r
Seeing my fellow Filipino Bboys go through the same hardships and struggles that so many of us in the world go through, has motivated me to try and bring "The Plan" to the Philippines. Could "The Plan" become a successful industry and sustainable business in the Philippines which can make a life-change in the crews, bboys, and family of the bboys in the Philippines? Below are the facts that I have learned in the Philippines:\r
\r
#1 - I can hire a someone to be a full time Bboy, for 9hrs a day, 5 days a week, for approximately $250 US dollars a month. This money is enough to change their lives!\r
\r
#2 - Philippine Laws states that a foreign investor (such as myself) cannot be a majority share holder in a company. Therefore, the most I could own is 49% of the company. This means that I would need partners and investors, who I can trust 100%.\r
\r
#3 - Getting business done in the Philippines, moves about as fast as their traffic... extremely slow. In other countries, you can get many things done in a day, but in the Philippines, because of the expected unpredictable traffic, you will be lucky if you can get more than one errand or task done. Therefore, many business men schedule their appointments between the small windows of the least amount of traffic. Even when I did manage to have meeting for business, due to the carefree joking nature of Filipinos, I was only able to get through the business pitch.\r
\r
#4 - The Manila Bboy scene is broken up into two scenes, North and South, which only come together for really huge international competitions. Bboys from the North rarely travel to the South for jams and vice versa, which means that finding the right location for a single Manila Blockhouse won't be easy.\r
\r
#5 - There are two types of people in the Philippines; Rich and Poor. The Bboy community has both types that are some what intermixed, which is very rare for both classes to mix together in the first place. While the lower class Bboys have more "raw talent", and tend to win all the Bboy jams, the upper class Bboys are more educated and will have more access to the resources needed execute "The Plan".\r
\r
Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that perhaps TWO Blockhouses might be the best solution, one planted in both the North and the South. The North Manila Blockhouse can more easily be successfully executed by a crew named Soulstice who was the first crew to win a qualifier in 2010, resulting in three members to be part of "Project P-Noise" aka team Philippines at the 2010 R16 World Finals. This crew consists of more privileged Bboys. Currently, only one of them is dancing as a full time job, and happens to be the Bboy who wins majority of solo battles in the Philippines. Reflex is my go to guy, while the others I am not yet sure if they're interest in the Bboy culture has dwindled. One of their main members lives in New York city but travels back and forth. If there is any crew who has the ability to create a North Manila Blockhouse and market a Team Manila, it's Soulstice. I tried contacting the only other crew who also has the ability and means to do "The Plan", but unfortunately couldn't set up a meeting.\r
\r
Now in the South of Metro Manila, is a totally different story, and a different kingdom. SAS Crew, is from one of the most dangerous areas in the Philippines called Baclaran, which I gave the nickname "Bronxclaran". When I first came to spread knowledge in the Philippines, I saw the passion and potential in SAS Crew, I could relate with them from where they come from and how they grew up, so I had a special place for them in my heart. I'm blessed to have been a part of their story, witnessing them grow, travelling around the world for breakin such as Denmark, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Japan, defeating world famous crews like MB, Zulu Kingz and Found Nation. SAS Crew has also joined the Zulu Nation, their chapter named Zulu Pinas, where they spread knowledge about Hip Hop culture and organize block parties and events. Majority of SAS crew are from the less privileged class, many have difficult upbringings and sad stories. While SAS Crew has the talent and the right Bboy mentality, they may have a harder time finding the resources and education to execute their own Blockhouse. Therefore, they will need to find the right investors and partners to make their own "SOUTH MANILA SAS CREW" business.\r
\r
In the end, I was able to accomplish a lot of research, not just on the Bboy culture, but in business as well. All the people I've met (non Bboys) agree that "The Plan" not only sounds like an amazing concept, but can be a lucrative business as well. Without talking about money, I have a feeling that finding the investment money won't be a problem, however I'm am hoping that the Bboys can learn to become business men and take ownership. I wasn't able to strike any deal except verbal commitments like "I'm down", and "What ever you do, we support you kuya", and at this point, that is all I needed to know.\r
\r
Besides taking care of business, I managed to get some training in, do a video shoot on a helipad, check out my old crew members wedding, watch a rock dance competition and hit up a jam where I called out a young Thread style Bboy in the cyphers. With such an amazing trip, I hope to do bboy business in the Philippines which will give me and my family a reason to come back every year for at least 3 months at a time, however all of these big dreams depend on the success of one thing... the prototype Blockhouse business in Taiwan!', '5 things I learned about bringing "THE PLAN" to the Philippines`

    title: "2018 Dyzee New Years Resolutions",
    html: `Dear Dyzee Diary,\r
\r
I guess I'm writing here on January 1st, the first day of the year, to set off my 2018 New Years Resolution, and keep myself on track while my readers can hold myself accountable.\r
\r
When I look back at 2017, I can see the many ups and downs, and the crazy transitions I've undergone. Firstly, I've been transitioning away from my dancing, which is quite frightening, because Bboying is all I've ever known. I feel as if my entire status is wrapped around my skills and ability on the dance floor, but now that I have been focusing less on my own dancing, my name and respect will eventually fade away. However, when I remember WHY I am no longer focusing on my own dancing career, I remember that I chose this path, to sacrifice my own career as a dancer, for something greater. We are going to create a better Bboying future where Bboys and Bgirls across the world can make a living just from dancing.To me, that comes first, I believe it is destiny.\r
\r
With that said, I understand that I was born to break, and battle. Both of those don't require entering competitions. I've already accomplished enough in my career that I don't have anything to prove in terms of dancing, except to remind people where majority of these global foundation of Toronto Style moves came from.\r
\r
One of the things I realized, that as we get older, our time gets divided. For example, when I was younger, all I had was breakin. So I devoted at least 50 hours a week to breakin. That is how I got to where I am today. However, like all people, when we get older, we join the rest of of the world in contributing some sort of "value" back to the world. The way this "value" is determined, is by how much "money" we earn. We exchange our "value points" for other "valuable goods and services". Basically, we need to get to work and make money. So some people break as a hobby, while working another job. Other people like myself, have chosen to use Breakin as our valuable contribution to the world. However, we as a culture have yet to solidify just how valuable Breakin "can be" to the rest of the world.Therefore, not only am I dividing my time between Breakin, and working to make money, but ALSO, trying to start a dream BBoyin Business.\r
\r
So I have 3 things on my plate.... my passion (Breakin)... my livelihood (Bboyin), and my dream (The Bboy Business). My passion, is what fuels my livelihood, which is how I earn a living for my wife and upcoming baby. And my livelihood helps to fund my dream. My Bboy Business when successful will eventually become my livelihood, where I no longer have to judge, teach workshops, and travel just to earn a living. However, with my daughter coming this March, I fear I won't have as much free time.\r
\r
Now I will use my time more wisely and sparingly as I want to be the best father ever. This is why I am breaking down my new years resolution into only 3 things... and they all start with the letter "P".\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>Pray</li>\r
 	<li>Practice</li>\r
 	<li>Produce</li>\r
</ol>\r
Every single day, I will do each of these things and see what the results are at the end of the year. I will spend time with God, through prayer, bible reading and worship. Without God, I get lost in this world, and feel so empty, always searching for happiness in the wrong places. Before God saved me, I was so lost, and everytime I look back at my life, at the point where I surrendered, I am so amazed at how blessed I am and how far I have come. It wasn't me, it was all him.\r
\r
Therefore, I will honor him by being who he created me to be... a Bboy. So I every single day, I will "exercise", whether it's practicing, working out, yoga, or whatever it is, I need to keep fit so that I can represent well who he created me to be.\r
\r
<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1058" src=${n} alt="" width="225" height="300" />And lastly, every day I will work on "producing" some sort of works such as Blogs, Vlogs, and most of all... finishing my upcoming book "Tao of the Bboy".\r
\r
Whether or not I'm travelling or busy, I will keep to all 3 of these New Years Resolutions, completing them every single day. Today, I have even downloaded an app called "Goal Tracker" that uses the "Don't Break The Chain" techniques to create good habits, or break bad habits. I've finally gotten rid of my bad habits, now it's time to make good ones!\r
\r
<img class="wp-image-1135  alignleft" src=${p} alt="" width="334" height="594" />I've learned that our habits will dictate who we are, and in order for me to complete all the dreams that God has placed in my heart, I need to develop daily habits that will get me there. I've created a list of dreams and destiny which I keep on the home screen of my phone. When I complete any of them, I cross them off my list. In the next few months, I will cross off one of them which has taken quite long to happen. And I if I work hard and stay focused, there will be another 3 or 4 of them that I will complete this year!\r
\r
For anyone who is reading this, (if any), feel free to follow me on this journey and keep me accountable. Any comments and shares would be greatly appreciated! Hoping to inspire you to do the same and dedicate 2018 to following your dreams and destiny!\r

    title: "Why RedBull BC One Should Stop Misusing the Word \u201CCypher\u201D",
    html: `Recently I was having a discussion over Korean BBQ &amp; soju dinner with my student about "cypher etiquette", and why he should't be afraid to dance in the cyphers. To my surprise, he mistakenly thought that I was talking about entering qualifiers for big name events! Now this wasn't the first time that I had to explain to young Bboys that when we elder and mid-skool Bboys are preaching about Cyphers, we absolutely are NOT talking about qualifiers or competitions.\r
\r
<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bc7XcQ4HJuS/?taken-by=dyzeediaries"><img class="alignright wp-image-1120 " src=${q} alt="" width="382" height="679" /></a>So I immediately, in a bit of an alcohol induced state, posted a tweet and tagged Redbull BC One, while also sharing the tweet on my Instagram account before going to bed, leaving the caption "I'll probably delete this tomorrow when I wake up #drunkdyzee". I usually re-post my tweets to my Instagram when I feel it's a tweet that everyone should hear, most of my tweet reposts get maybe 200-300 likes at most.\r
\r
When I woke up the next day, I noticed my post had over 70 comments and 1500 likes, with nearly everyone agreeing with me and asking me not to delete the post... because it's true.\r
\r
Now this got me thinking, if atleast 1500 Bboys and Bgirls from around the world, actually agree with me that RedBull BC One should change the qualifier name from "Cypher" to something else, could or would they actually do it? Would they actually care or take this request into consideration, or will they dismiss our request like big corporations usually do to the Bboy culture?\r
\r
This is an interesting and important topic but before I "Break-It-Down", I need to clarify something.\r
\r
In no way is this a personal attack on Red Bull BC One. I actually am a big fan of the BC One brand and am grateful that there is an event of this caliber and magnitude. The fact that there exists a solo Bboy competition of this prestige which creates an annual platform and stage for 16 Bboys to compete for "the world championship solo title" is awesome, important and appreciated by our culture. Although I do have some gripes that a solo Bboy battle of this size has had a few negative effects on crew culture and the next generation, I'll save that for another discussion. What I'm trying to say is that I don't blame Redbull BC One for misusing the word cypher, and there is no way that they could have known the problems or harm that it can potentially cause. All I'm trying to do is bring this to topic to light, as other Bboys in the scene who work with Red Bull would be afraid to do so for fear of losing out on work.\r
\r
With that said, here are my arguments why RedBull BC One should stop misusing the word "Cypher"\r
\r
<strong>#1"ITS NOT AN ACTUAL CYPHER"</strong>\r
\r
Before I break this down, I should explain where the term "cypher" even came from. Back in the early days, Bboys and Bgirls danced in "circles", which was the original term. These circles were only found in parties where a crowd would form a circle around the dancers. However, rappers and emcees would get together outside of parties, such as in the parks or on the streets, and would exchange with each other rhymes, playing off each other's words, rhymes and topics. These were called "rap ciphers" where they were trying to "decipher", who was the best and had the most rhymes and skills.\r
\r
In the early 90's, Bboys and Bgirls still called it circles as they mainly danced at parties. However in the mid 90's, with the steady growth of "hip hop" jams which eventually changed into "Bboy Jams" (a hip hop jam dedicated for Bboys without a competition) the emcees started calling it "Bboy ciphers". While circles was usually formed by non-bboy crowds, a cipher consisted of mainly Bboys (and Bgirls), each one of them adding to the conversation, going off each other's styles, moves and concepts, together trying to "decipher", who was the best and had the most style, moves and skills. Majority of the time, the cipher itself would decide who are the best two, who would eventually and organically, battle it out. To simply state, circles was for showing off to the crowd, while ciphers were for seeing what the other Bboys got and finding out who is the best. The word "cipher", was later also spelled as "cypher", and more recently became the common way of spelling.\r
\r
What was amazing about this cypher phenomenon, was that it didn't need any judges. The cypher is where the dance really evolved into all these "Klassic New Skool" styles, moves, concepts and approaches. The cypher was and is instrumental to a Bboys growth, in order for one to gain the right confidence, to understand the conversation, the approach, the details, the etiquette and especially, the culture.\r
\r
Unfortunately, a lot of young Bboys not only lack the opportunity to dance in a real cypher, but also do not understand what a cypher's purpose even is, or how important it is for our culture, and their personal development. Which brings me to my next argument:\r
\r
<strong>#2 "MISUSING THE WORD CYPHER, CAN CONFUSE AND HARM THE NEXT GENERATION OF BBOYS"</strong>\r
\r
Now I know that may sound like an over dramatic statement, but there is truth to it. It's no secret that many elder Bboys keep pushing the importance and significance of circles and cyphers. For the advancement of our Bboy community, we want our next generation of Bboys to be able to learn and progress in the right way, to figure out the dance, their style and the culture the traditional way, which is in the circles and cyphers. The cypher is an exchange of ideas, styles and moves, and it will not only let a Bboy know if they are ready or not, but also if they even have enough arsenal to even enter a competition. Many new Bboys of this generation don't know how to dance in a cypher, and only enter competitions. These young Bboys need a guru (aka judge) to tell them how to dance instead of finding out who they truly are and full potential on their own.\r
\r
Calling a qualifier a cypher, not only confuses the next generation of Bboys, but also makes it difficult for elder Bboys to teach what a cypher truly is. A cypher is not a qualifier. A cypher doesn't have set amount of rounds or time limits. A cypher winner is not determined by the biased opinion of a judge, but rather by the Bboys and Bgirls who are partaking in that mutual exchange. A cypher, is how our culture and communities participants can truly enjoy the dance, art and culture outside of competitions.\r
\r
I'm not saying that competitions aren't important. They are very important in bringing our community together and for creating some sort of financial incentives for a few select participants with a rep. However,This brings me to my third and final point.\r
\r
<strong>#3 WE AS A CULTURE NEED TO PRESERVE THE ESSENCE OF A TRUE CYPHER</strong>\r
\r
Imagine that ballers (basket ball enthusiasts) only enter formal tournaments and never go to the local courts to play a game of streetball or have a fun game... the basketball culture would go downhill, especially if ballers couldn't enjoy a game of streetball without having to wait to enter an official tournament. The same goes for Breakin!\r
\r
The cypher is our playground, our skatepark, our outdoor basketball court, and the only problem is that we need to teach the next generation how to use it, and enjoy it. The more we move away from the cyphers, the more our culture moves away from the rawness... the "fun" side of Breakin, where the thrill of the battle is more important than a win or loss.\r
\r
Everyone knows that I'm a big advocate for professional battles and I'm not afraid of the term "sport". However, not at the expense of losing our traditions, history and the raw essence of the dance, art and culture.\r
\r
With that said, I invite Red Bull BC One to stand up and make a change, prove to us that you really care about the betterment of our culture which has brought your brand millions upon millions of views and fan engagement around the world. All I'm asking, is for you to consider the following two options:\r
\r
<strong>A) Make your qualifiers into REAL cyphers</strong>\r
\r
Perhaps throw a cypher only jam. Have judges walk around and give "cipher passes" out to the best Bboys that they want to see rocking in a final ultimate cypher. Then have them cypher it out with no time limit until the judges choose either the winner, or the two that they want to see battle. This will teach the young Bboys what a true cypher is, and when you call it a BC One Cypher... it will really be a cypher!\r
\r
<strong>B) Change the name "cypher" to something more better and fitting</strong>\r
\r
Allow me to make some suggestions:\r
<ol>\r
 	<li>redbull bcone QUALIFIERS</li>\r
 	<li>redbull bcone NATIONALS</li>\r
 	<li>redbull bcone HEATSAnd my personal favorite is....</li>\r
 	<li>redbull bcone STAGES</li>\r
</ol>\r
I like the word stage because it fits! Not only is it "stage 1" of the qualifiers, but it's also a literal "stage" which serves as a platform to showcase the best Bboy talent. For example, Red Bull BC One Canada STAGE!\r
\r
Not a bad ring to it eh?`

    title: "The Never Ending Discussion On BITING",
    html: `Today I replied to a facebook post by my dear friend DJ Renegade, on another discussion about BITING. This is a topic we have been discussing and debating forever. Renegade posed some very good questions such as:\r
<blockquote>I need your views and clarity on some issues that need to be discussed. I don't think there are simple, single right answers but we should be able to reach some sort of consensus. We are in a point in history where we need working definitions of certain things. The time for personal, uniformed views is coming to an end.\r
Of course, this is about judging.\r
Bites and repeats specifically.\r
What is a bite and how should it/they be penalised?\r
What is a repeat and how should it/they be penalised?\r
How do you identify a bite? How much knowledge does it require to be aware of every move created and their owner?\r
Is it even possible nowadays?\r
How much 'flipping' is enough and how do we decide?\r
If I take a move and cross my legs or touch my left nipple while doing it, is that a new move? I don't find that very creative at all.\r
Is there a hierarchy? ie which is worse? Are 2 small bites equal to one big one?\r
Is biting style worse than biting a move?\r
What is a 'move'?\r
When does a 'move' become bite-able? ie windmills, swipes, halos etc all 'belonged' to and were the signatures of someone at some point, when do they become public domain?\r
If you got a move from a crew member is it a bite? If I taught you all your vocab, where does that fit in?\r
I see whole crews of people ending in a baby or chair freeze. Is that bite-repeat? Extra penalty?</blockquote>\r
To his post I replied with:\r
\r
Awesome questions Kev.\r
\r
The questions you pose is the reason why I believe that judging should be categorized into the different perspectives (angles, takes, approaches, views) of breakin. Each perspective on breakin should be judged by a qualified specialist in that particular view (value).\r
\r
Biting is a value that isn't shared by everyone. Those who do share that value, weigh it differently.\r
\r
With that said, I believe that someone who is respected, acknowledged and has proven to understand and demonstrate, what is originality (and biting) should be on a panel to judge and take care of the whole biting aspect.\r
\r
You can't teach every Bboy out there, how to judge on bites, especially when they don't value biting in their own dancing.\r
\r
But for other people, particularly the 90's golden era Bboys, originality and biting is extremely important, studying whose move is what, and properly changing them is a mandatory requirement.\r
\r
Now about BITING VS INSPIRATION\r
\r
Anytime someone throws down a move, style, step or concept that was created by someone else, without flipping, changing, adding creativity to, leveling up, with the exact same entrance and exit, (outside of a response to say I can do that shit too) is a freakin BITE.\r
\r
How a move becomes universal, is when a signature move, becomes flipped, upgraded, added to, with tons of variations by the culture, then the core move itself, becomes universal. For example, Uzeerock, does his signature elbow spin. In the far future, people will find ways to flip it, like airflare into it, switch elbows, hop it, curl into ball, put their legs in lotus, find amazing combos into and out of it... basically take it to the next level. At that time, the Uzee elbow spin will become a universal move... but for now, nobody can do it. lol\r
\r
Ownership of move, belongs to a Bboy and in many cases, the crew that created that particular style of movement. For example, we can expect everyone in my crew<a class="profileLink" dir="ltr" href="https://www.facebook.com/supernaturalz92/?hc_location=ufi" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/hovercard.php?id=182384979803&amp;extragetparams=%7B%22hc_location%22%3A%22ufi%22%7D">Supernaturalz</a>to be doing and sharing all the moves in our history to keep our style and history alive. We will be working to do it better than everyone else.\r
\r
How do we penalize Bites?\r
Well I think it will be unfair to just throw out penalties for bites like "You lose because I think i saw that move before!" that would not be fair. Bad judges would use that as an excuse to make people they don't like, lose.\r
Instead, a system should be giving points.... errr should i say "PROPS", for CREATIVITY, and it takes a judge who really values creativity in order to spot creativity.\r
\r
I think a better way to handle the whole judging creativity, is to ask the community, who do they feel or believe to be the cultures leading authorities on ORIGINALITY and CREATIVITY? Then whomever the culture selects, ask them how they would judge it.\r
\r
That may be the best way to approach the whole biting topic. Ask the experts\r
\r
PS. Anyone reading this, which Bboys out there do you feel represent Originality, Creativity the most and who you would trust in their opinions in regards to biting?`

    title: "My Seoul Seekers squad calls out our first Korean Bboys!",
    html: `<img class="alignleft wp-image-1102" src=${s} alt="" width="354" height="209" />In 2012, I was asked to coach a group of foreigners who were living in Korea. At that time, I noticed that there were so many foreigner Bboys living in Korea, each of them, hungry to experience all that the Korean Bboy scene had to offer. What many people didn't know, was that getting into the Korean Bboy scene, isn't easy at all.\r
\r
The Korean Bboy scene is quite "CLAN'ish, in the sense that each of the crews, really stick to their own. Unlike most Bboy scenes around the world, there aren't many open practices at all. Pretty much all the top crews, have their own private studios to practice in, which isn't open to the public. Therefore you need to be invited, which I didn't have much of a problem with, but I noticed these foreigner Bboys did.\r
\r
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/theseoulseekers"><img class="alignright wp-image-1104 " src=${r} alt="" width="516" height="290" /></a>Thus I decided to create a squad, comprising of all the foreigner Bboys and Bgirls who for whatever reason, were temporarily living in Seoul Korea. In the beginning, I put my heart and soul into leading the crew the same way that I lead the Supernaturalz. Just as I had lead many other crews around the world to become hometown, national or world champions, I was determine to lead the Seoul Seekers down the same path.\r
\r
Sadly, the reality hit me, that this squad of Bboys living in Korea, is a transient bunch, each member only temporary until he or she moves back to their home and rejoins their original crew. Thus, being a "serious" squad with the intent of becoming a world champion crew wasn't everyone's goal, but rather, this crew was a place that they can temporarily belong, a home away from home.\r
\r
Thus the Seoul Seekers became a "Bboy Social Club", where the members would train every Saturday from 11am-2pm at The Dance Box in Jongak district. I continue to lead the sessions with warm-ups, drills, cyphers and mini lessons from time to time. Each of the members pays a monthly membership fee of 25,000 KRW ($25) or can pay a one time fee of 7,000 KRW ($7).\r
\r
Recently, the our Seoul Seekers club has discussed setting up exhibition call out battles in nightclubs, which would turn into parties afterwards where we can invite all our fellow foreigners and expats to come support us, and after party with us.\r
\r
<img class="alignright wp-image-1100" src=${t} alt="" width="269" height="381" />Our first battle will be on Dec 2nd 2017 in one of the biggest clubs in Seoul Korea, formerly called Club Answer, now called Club Avenue. It will be a special party event with 15 promoters coming together.We will be battling against a united university mixed team comprising of the two top universities in Korea. Yonsei University and Korea National University.\r
\r
I'm hoping that this battle will not only be an amazing battle, but a dope experience for all our friends and supporters who come watch this. If this goes well, we will be making a monthly event out of it, slowly battling crews one by one working our way up the chain in Korea, showing and proving that BBOYS CAN MAKE LIVING FROM BATTLING!!\r
\r
If you are available this Saturday, feel free to come! It's free when you are on our Seoul Seekers Guestlist! To get on our guestlist, click "Going" on our facebook page, and on the night of the event, give your name at the door under the Seoul Seekers Guestlist!\r

    title: "When I was a Model Bboy for POUND Magazine",
    html: `Back in the mid 2000's I was hired to do a photoshoot for Toronto famous, POUND Magazine. As you can see in the photos above, the photographer "Che Kotari" was able to produce a pretty unique 8 page spread which tells a story of a villainous Bboy who sells out his crew, while stealing their move and using it against them. I'm not 100% sure where they got the inspiration of this story, but it's funny because it actually parallels a story in my own life.\r
\r
Here in this project, I was asked to do my signature freeze atleast 50 times, which was really difficult. Today, i can't even do the freeze anymore, but back then I could hit it 9/10 times, even when I was tired.\r
\r
Just thought I would share this little project I did on my new website.`

    html: `I made a promise to God that if my wife ever got pregnant, I would begin writing a book about my life and Bboy journey, sharing all my stories, secrets and lessons learned which has shaped me into the man and Bboy I am today.\r
\r
My wife is now 5 months pregnant and we have a daughter on the way. The name of the book will be called "Tao of the Bboy" which is tribute to Bruce Lee's first book "Tao of Jeet Kune Do". A synonym for the word Tao, is spirit or essence.\r

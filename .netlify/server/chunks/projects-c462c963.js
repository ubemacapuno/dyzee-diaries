    <p>Back To The Underground (aka B2DU) was established in 1999 as the first Bboy tournament event competition in Toronto Canada by the Supernaturalz crew. Lead by Dyzee, B2DU grew to become a Bboy marketing and events company, organizing many of the major events in the Toronto & eastcoast Canadian Bboy scene, and is responsible for creating and growing the Bboy community in the region.

  Back To The Underground is still running today in Toronto Canada, lead by Supernaturalz member Lee Pham</p>

<p>In the beginning of 2019, Dyzee publicly announced that he would be creating and designing the first ever sneaker, designed specifically for the dance and artform of Breakin.  Partnering with a factory in Surabaya Indonesia, the first prototypes were created entitled \u201CThe Numbawonz\u201D.</p>

    title: "OUR CITY BBOYS: Rival City Battle League",
    html: `
    <p>
      In 2016, Dyzee began working on a new battle format which would go against the traditional tournament bracket formula, and instead focus on promoting a full length rival city judged exhibition battle with only two teams called \u201CShowdowns\u201D.

      The objective was to prove that the general audience who are non-participants could watch and enjoy a showdown in the same way one would watch a pro sporting match.  Using an audience educating criteria based judging system (OUR System), while using a unique battle format based on a race to win three, 5 Round battles with breaks in between, each showdown successfully built and cultivated a fan-base for the Chiayi City Dream Runnerz.

      The OUR City Bboys showdowns have proven that a format similar to professional team sports which focuses on marketing a home city team can generate fans for a home city team.

<p>The O.U.R. System is the first criteria based, objective scoring system, globally launched in 2010, implemented at all R16 Global Series events.

  Ahead of it's time, the O.U.R. system was based on the unity and equal weight of the 5 Pillar Perspectives of Bboying. Each of the five judges would be assigned to one of the 5 categories, giving a score from 1-5 points every turn. The winner is decided by how many of the 5 perspectives was won.
  
  First conceptualized in 1999, the system focused on \u201Cobjectivity\u201D, fairness through \u201Cunity\u201D of the five angles, as well as transparency through \u201CReal time\u201D scoring on displays, while keeping true to the essence and intent of the traditional cypher battles. However, \u201Ceducation\u201D of both the participants and fans was a major objective in the system's development.</p>

<p>
Project P-Noise, was a  not-for-profit project with the mission to develop the talent and Bboy community in the Philippines into a thriving scene, starting in 2009, until it's completion in 2014.  From a non existent Bboy scene with only a hand full of Bboys to now a thriving scene with high level Bboy event organizers, asia regional qualifiers, hundreds of talented Bboys and international champions, the Project P-Noise initiative played the most crucial role in jump starting and guiding the Philippine Bboy community to what it is today, through a carefully planned and well-though out process.

<p>Since 2010, Dyzee began working as the Global Tournament Producer for the R16 World Championships, successfully creating national qualifiers and regional eliminations around the world. He successfully branded the R16 Global Series as the olympics of the Bboying, implementing the first ever criteria based judging system.

  Dyzee's ability to produce global events and in some of the most unlikely places such as Nepal, Philippines, & Mongolia to name a few, came from a mix of his Bboy reputation and easily accessibility on social media, but also his devotion to sharing his event organization knowledge by creating step by step partnership manuals, teaching how to build successful events from the ground up.
  
  In 2016, the Korean government cancelled funding for R16 World Championships.</p>

<h3>The Opportunity</h3>

<p>
  The Bboy phenomenon\u2026 a global self-governing rebellious dance culture and movement, has proven to be more than just a fad by surviving through two Breakin Booms (aka major media explosions in the 80's and mid 2000's), without its own industry or ecosystem to support, enhance, sustain or benefit the culture to allow Bboyin to reach its full booming potential, resulting in its two mainstream media deaths.

With the steady rise of big budget world championship tournaments and the recent announcement that \u201CBreakin\u201D has been added to the 2018 Youth Olympics in Buenos Aires, a 3rd Breakin Boom is on the horizon. Now is the time to prepare ourselves to catch the wave, by taking the Bboy industry to a higher level, using a fan cultivating business structure and format which has been proven successful in other industries, by serving it's practitioners while generating large financial profits and returns on investments from general audiences and sponsorship dollars.

If we wait until the third Breakin Boom comes, it will be too late as other outside interests will flood to exploit the culture from the media craze, especially without any proper protection and infrastructure to ensure that the Breakin Boom will not fade away like the 80's, or the mid 2000's in Korea.

We must act now
</p>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<p>
  The Blockhouse is the ultimate Bboy Clubhouse, mini-Arena & Training facility for the first registered Bboy Social Club and home base for the home city's professional BBoy (Breakdancing) TOP Crew or All-star team, which is a registered Bboy club of the future EXHIBITION BATTLE LEAGUE & URBAN CULTURAL SPORTS. The pro-team consists of 8-15 of the current best B-Boys or representatives, from across the city, and will battle against other rival cities in seasonal exhibition battle which rules and judges are agreed upon by publicized meetings called \u201CRules of Engagement\u201D Press Conferences.  The battles are a blend of professional sports, hip hop concerts and sports entertainment which will rapidly cultivate diehard fans and business partnerships, and provides the ultimate space for city wide practitioners of the art to develop their craft and call a 2nd home.
